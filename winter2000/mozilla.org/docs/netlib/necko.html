necko: the new netlib project</h1></center>

<center>
<h2>
<i>"it's wafer thin"</i></h2></center>
Last updated: 4/14/99
<br>Author: Warren Harris &amp; Rick Potts
<p>Mozilla's current networking library is in a sorry state. Remnants of
the old "mozilla classic" codebase pervade, and coupled with the fact that
it was designed for a radically different non-threaded world where it was
the primary scheduler for the browser (and performance is abysmal because
this is no longer the case causing us to have to "poll" netlib to get any
work done) -- we decided that it was about time to take the situation under
control. [<a href="history.html">historical reference</a>]
<h2>
overview</h2>
The main function that the netlib kernel serves is to act as an efficient
data pipe between multiple physical transports (ie. file system, network,
etc.) and a standardized stream abstraction which protocol handlers consume.
<h2>
goals</h2>
There are three main design goals in the Necko kernel architecture - footprint,
maintainability and performance.
<p>It is hoped that both the disk and memory footprint of Necko will be
substantially smaller than the existing netlib.&nbsp; Existing dead code
will be eliminated and the new modular design will allow "just enough"
networking support to be loaded at any one time.&nbsp; This is in contrast
to the existing netlib which is monolithic (500k for the core, not including
mail/news protocols).
<p>It is hoped that the new modular design and implementation of Necko
will prove more maintainable than the existing code base.&nbsp; The biggest
maintenance issues with the existing code base are its age (almost 5 years
old) and the fact that the code was designed for a very different client
architecture than Gecko. This new design is tailored toward a component-based
client and is well suited to an open source environment where individuals
can contribute new custom functionality to augment the core kernel implementation.
<p>The implementation of Necko will include instrumentation mechanisms
allowing a quantitive analysis of performance.&nbsp; Also, the pluggable
nature of this architecture allows for custom (platform dependent) implementations
to be substituted for the XP reference implementations provided within
the netlib kernel.&nbsp; For example, a custom Win32 specific transport
module could be written to maximize the performance of file I/O by utilizing
platform specific APIs...
<h2>
architecture</h2>
The netlib kernel can be divided into several functional pieces.
<ul>
<li>
URLs</li>

<li>
Protocol handlers</li>

<li>
Protocol connections</li>

<li>
Transports</li>

<li>
Supporting services</li>
</ul>
The following diagram illustrates the basic architecture:
<center><img SRC="ArchDiagram.JPG" height=464 width=503></center>

<p>The application program initiates a network request by consructing a
URL object and loading it. The network service (nsINetService) is a global
singleton object obtained from the service manager that facilitates the
construction and opening of URLs. The network service also provides functionality
needed to support plug-in protocol implementations.
<p>The network service extracts the scheme of the URL (the protocol name
portion, e.g. "http:") and looks up a protocol handler to field the request.
The protocol handler begins by constructing a URL object designed to work
hand-in-hand with the protocol. The URL object can be an implementation
supporting
custom parsing code for that protocol's specified URL syntax, or a can
be a "typical" URL implementation (one that only supports the accessors
of nsIUrl, e.g. host, port, path, etc.) if that is all that is required
by the protocol.
<p>After building the URL object, the network service again contacts the
protocol handler to load the URL. The protocol handler is then responsible
for constructing a protocol connection object (nsIProtocolConnection) for
the URL request. There is a one-to-one correspondence between protocol
connections and URL load requests.
<p>The protocol connection provides any protocol-specific accessors required
by the protocol. For example, for the http protocol these include accessing
the headers, making byte range requests, posting, etc. Any protocol-specific
interfaces are obtained by calling QueryInterface on the protocol connection.
<h3>
transports and threading</h3>
Within the protocol connection's implementation, transport objects (nsITransport)
are used to make actual physical connections to the sources of data. The
two most prominent examples of transports are socket transports for reading
and writing to network sockets, and file transports for reading and writing
to the file system. Others might include a JAR-file transport (for accessing
data from JAR or ZIP files), or perhaps a timer transport (for getting
periodic callbacks). Some protocols like http may reuse open transports
for "keep alive" requests.
<p>Transports will run in their own logical thread, thereby allowing the
application thread(s) to run asynchronously. When data comes in for a transport,
the transport thread will marshal that data over to the application thread.
The application thread will actually deal with parsing the incoming data
(the protocol packet), and then pass application-specific data contained
therein up to the application through a "protocol event sink." For the
http protocol, the event sink will call the html parser as well as deliver
progress and status notifications. For protocols like IMAP, the event sink
will notify of events like new folder creation or incoming message arrival.
<p>For socket transport requests, there will most likely be a single socket
transport thread managing a pool of file descriptors for all outstanding
socket requests. When data comes in for a socket, the socket transport
thread will marshal that data over to the application thread. For file
transport requests, there will be a default implementation of the file
transport service that manages a pool of threads. Each incoming file transport
request will be dispatched to the next available file transport thread.
The number of file transport threads will be small (like 4), and is a tuning
parameter. Again, when data comes in from a file, the file transport thread
will marshal the data over to the application thread.
<p>Applications received the marshaled data in one of two ways: synchronously
or asynchronously. By requesting an input or output stream from a connection,
applications can operate synchronously with respect to the protocol, blocking
on read and write operations, respectively. This technique is used by protocol
implementations that run in their own thread and can afford to block (and
do nothing else) while waiting for data to come in from the transport.
By making an asynchronous read or write request, applications can share
their thread between parsing the protocol and performing other activities
(such as running the UI). Using this technique, events will be delivered
to the thread's event loop when data arrives, calling a stream listener
(nsIStreamListener) that was supplied when the asynchronous request was
made. Protocol-specific accesses can be done is a similar way, either synchronously
or asynchronously. These will manifest themselves as "outbound commands"
on the connection, or as asynchronous requests and "inbound events" on
the application's event sink respectively (see the diagram, above).
<p>Isolating the transport from the protocol handlers provides a single
point where platform specific optimizations can be performed on a per transport
basis.&nbsp; For example, a custom Win32 implementation of the file transport
using overlapped file I/O could be written without disturbing the rest
of the netlib implementation. Each transport is responsible for efficiently
scheduling its transport requests. In general, a transport implementation
will run in its own thread to avoid polling. Transport implementations
are responsible for timing out requests which have not been fulfilled within
a specific amount of time. The transport layer also provides a central
point to perform resource throttling (ie. limiting the number of simultaneous
connections) and connection pooling such as reusing open connections for
subsequent requests.
<h2>

Necko project:
<ul>
<li>
provide general feedback on our design and implementation</li>

<li>
build stand-alone tests for the file and socket transport layers</li>

<li>
build a general stand-alone test harness for testing the various protocols</li>

<li>
write a wrapper to allow the Microsoft inet.dll to work under the Necko
APIs</li>

transport</li>

<li>
implement miscellaneous protocols, e.g. WAIS, Gopher (after protocol architecture
is further along)</li>

<li>
