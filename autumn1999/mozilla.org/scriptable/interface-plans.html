<center><h2>XPConnect interface plans</h2></center>
<center><a href="mailto:jband@netscape.com">John Bandhauer</a> - 8 Dec 1998</center>
<p>

This is a quick and dirty overview of some of the interfaces and the internal
mechanisms I am working on for XPConnect to support COM identity and maximize
sharing of objects. Much handwaving remains...

<p>

Note that what is elsewhere called <code>JS2CPPProxy</code> is here called
<code>WrappedNative</code> and what is elsewhere called <code>CPP2JSProxy</code> is
here called <code>WrappedJS</code>.

<h3>The InterfaceInfo subsystem</h3>
<p>

<i>[Scott Furman is looking closer at representing interface data on his
own. These are just my ideas]</i>

<p>

<b>nsIInterfaceInfoFactory</b>

<p>

This interface will encapsulate information files. It can return an
nsIInterfaceInfo object for any given UIID. It should provide services (on its
own or through some helper class?) to read and write InterfaceInfo files.
A single instance of this factory, and the InterfaceInfo objects it dispenses,
could be shared at runtime by various client modules.

<p>

<b>nsIInterfaceInfo</b>

<p>

This interface will encapsulate one XPCOM interface - i.e. one UIID. It can
return information about that interface including the name, the superinterface,
the number of methods, an information object about each method, and information
about constants defined by the interface. It should be able to hide
superinterface boundaries. i.e. when asked for method info objects it should
return those of the superinterface chain as if they were part of this interface.
We may have methods in this object to return these 'flattened' sets of methods
and constants, and alternate methods to return only those of the directly
represented interface.

<p>

<b>nsIMethodInfo</b>

<p>

This interface will encapsulate one method. It will have methods to get the
name, the number of params, and each param.

<p>

<b>nsIParamInfo</b>

<p>

This interface will encapsulate one paramerter. It will have methods to get the
type and modifiers (e.g. in, out, in/out, is_iid reference, etc). Optionally we
could expose the param name. We might decide to not expose nsIMethodInfo as an
object and instead just have nsIMethodInfo return an encoded string or
array of bytes representing the params?

<p>

The InterfaceInfo system will be used by XPConnect, but it ought to stand on
its own. The XPIDL compiler ought to use it to write InterfaceInfo files. Other
tools should be able to use it to read, modify, merge. and split those files. It
should not depend either on XPIDL or XPConnect if we can avoid those
dependencies.
             
<p>

<h3>The XPConnect Runtime</h3>

<p>

<b>nsIXPConnectRuntime (implemented by nsXPConnectRuntime)</b>

<p>

nsXPConnectRuntime objects will be instantiated one to one with nsIJSRuntime;
i.e. there will be a factory which takes an nsIJSRuntime as a param to create
instances of nsXPConnectRuntime. nsIXPConnectRuntime is used to bootstrap
XPCOM into the JS environment and to supply wrappers used for JS calling XPCOM
and XPCOM calling JS.

<p>

Bootstrapping mainly consists of reflecting the runtime registry and some other
'well known' (potentially application specific) objects into JavaScript. This
allows JavaScript to access and instantiate XPCOM objects and also to register
JavaScript objects with the shared registry to be accessed by arbitrary XPCOM
objects.

<p>

We should develop a standard namespace in JS for access to these well known
objects: perhaps an object named 'xpcom' to which these well known
objects can be attached as properties. We may add default code to make this
easy. But, in fact, this can be done easily with normal jsapi calls.

<p>

The key methods of nsIXPConnectRuntime are those that do the wrapping.
XPCOM Interfaces and JS objects passed across existing XPConnect wrappers will
be automatically wrapped. However, nsIXPConnectRuntime will provide explicit
interfaces for bootstrapping and for XPCOM code that wants to
explicitly construct graphs of reflected XPCOM interfaces in a JavaScript
context.

<p>

The primary interfaces of nsIXPConnectRuntime are:

<pre>
    NS_IMETHOD WrapNative(nsIJSContext* aJSContext, nsISupports* aCOMObj,
                          REFNSIID aIID, nsICCWrappedNative** aWrapper) = 0;

    NS_IMETHOD WrapJS(nsIJSContext* aJSContext, nsIJSObject* aJSObj, 
                      REFNSIID aIID, nsICCWrappedJS** aWrapper) = 0;

</pre>

<p>

The wrappers are XPCOM objects and are reference counted. The wrappers
constructed (or found) by WrappedJS expose a GetJSObject method to allow callers to
construct relationships between the wrapper and other JSObjects using the jsapi.

<p>

Both kinds of wrappers follow similar rules...

<p>

I'm planning a 'fully-factored' class graph to implement this system. We need
to construct distinct wrapper instances for each interface of a given object,
however, many different objects may expose the same interface. I'll factor out
those common parts into objects which can be shared by separate wrappers.

<p>

In order to correctly support COM identity rules the various wrappers for the
various interfaces of a given wrapped object will be linked in a list. The root
object of the linked list of wrappers will be the wrapper representing
nsISupports. Often that wrapper is also the same wrapper that supports some
other interface. In fact, most typically, a given wrapped object will only be
wrapped for nsISupports and one 'interesting' interface. And most objects will
return the same pointer when QueryInterface calls are made asking for
nsISupports and an 'interesting' interface. In these most common cases we need
only generate one wrapper.

<p>

Each wrapper will have a pointer to the 'root' wrapper and to a 'next' wrapper.
The root wrapper's 'root' pointer will point to itself (and thus we can see that
it is the root). A hash table will be maintained that allows us to get at the
root wrapper for any wrapped object. From there we can walk the links looking
for a wrapper that 'does' the interface desired. It will sometimes be necessary
to do a QueryInterface of 'nsISupports' on the interface we want to wrap in
order to get the 'right' key for the hash table lookup. We can find or add
the appropriate wrapper as necessary (sometimes having to create a new root
wrapper for an object if none existed before).

<p>

The wrappers are linked together but are individually reference counted.
However, they are not individually freed. Rather, they are freed en mass when
all become unreachable. For WrappedNative wrappers 'unreachability' is a cross
between reference counts going to zero and the JSObject finalizer having been
called. The JSObject components of these wrappers will be rooted in JavaScript's
gc system while XPCOM holds references and unrooted when the refcount goes to
zero. So, the freeing happens only when JavaScript's gc decides to finalize the
wrapper.

<p>

<b>QueryInterface for for wrapped JavaScript objects...</b>

<p>

The WrappedJS wrappers allow JavaScript objects to be reflected into XPCOM. In
order to succeed, the JavaScript object must implement the methods declared by
the given interface. In many real world uses of XPCOM a given object may be
expected to implement more than one interface. For instance, an object claiming
to be a a specific kind of widget might need to implement the interface of that
specific kind of widget and also the common nsIWidget interface. 

<p>

To support this idiom I think we should support QueryInterface of wrapped
objects implemented in JavaScript. We want it to be easy to implement XPCOM
interfaces in JavaScript, so we don't want to require that all wrapped
JavaScript objects support QueryInterface. So... 

<p>

If a wrapped JavaScript object has no QueryInterface method then we assume that
the object only supports the interface for which it was wrapped. Any XPCOM
caller of QueryInterface on that wrapped object will receive that same wrapper
when asking for either that interface or for nsISupports and will receive errors
when other interfaces are requested. 

<p>

If the wrapped JavaScript object does have a QueryInterface method then we call
it. We will have a means of representing UUIDs in JavaScript to pass to the
QueryInterface call. The object can return itself or some other object when
asked for a given interface (or it can fail - return null or possible we'll use
exception handling?). Being able to return some other object allows it to
implement the multiple interfaces through delegation or whatever means it
chooses and to avoid problems when more than one interface uses a method with
the same name but different meaning. In order to make the wrapping work right it
is required that any object that does implement QueryInterface must also 'do the
right thing' when asked for the nsISupports (i.e. the root) interface. The same
is true of any objects it returns from a call to QueryInterface. And all objects
thus returned as representing different interfaces of the same 'virtual' object
must return the same object when asked for the nsISupports object. This allows
us to support COM identity rules everywhere.

<p>

<b>Factoring...</b>

<p>

For each instance of the WrappedNative wrapper we need to build a JSObject with the
appropriate method stubs, getters/setters, and constant properties. I propose
that to simplify this we lazily build a JSClass for each kind of interface (one
per InterfaceInfo) and share that JSClass between WrappedNative instances. These
can not be directly shared across JSRuntimes, so they will be per
nsIXPConnectRuntime. So, for each nsXPConnectRuntime we'll maintain a
hashtable keyed by UIID that returns an object that contains both an
InterfaceInfo reference (which can be shared across JSRuntimes) and a JSClass.
We build these as needed. They can be found/constructed whenever a new
WrappedNative wrapper is constructed.

<p>

<i>[<code>10 Dec - jband - </code> Scott Furman pointed out that just sharing a
JSClass would not have the intended effect because property set calls cause new
properties to be set on the object instances rather than calling the class's
setter as I intended. He suggested building these Wrapper objects using the
newer ObjectOps callback system in the jsapi to allow more direct per object
handling. LiveConnect uses this strategy. I'll look closer at that code.
Nevertheless, a 'per class' shared object can handle this aspect for the various
Wrapper instances used for a given interface.]</i> 

<p>

The nsXPConnectRuntime will also hold one hashtable each to map XPCOM objects
to WrappedNative wrappers and to map JSObjects to WrappedJS wrappers. In both cases
the wrapped objects will be the 'root' object as returned by a QueryInterface
for nsISupports and the wrapper will be the appropriate 'root' wrapper (from
which we can find wrappers for other interfaces on the object as explained
previously). We can support an xpcom.equals method that takes two objects (in
JavaScript) and determins if they represent the same underlying object. This can
work whether the objects are JavaScript which happen to have WrappedJS wrappers or
the JSObject object exposed into JavaScript of WrappedNative wrappers. Either way
xpcom.equals can do the grunt work to check for COM identity.
