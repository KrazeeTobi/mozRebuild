<h2>New Layout: Style System</h2> 
Author: <a href="mailto:plinss@netscape.com">Peter 
Linss</a> <BR>
Updated: 5/1/98
<HR>
<BR>
<TABLE COLS=1 WIDTH="70%" >
<TR BGCOLOR="#FFFFCC">
<TD><B>Overview</B></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
The NGLayout Style System is comprised of three 
sections that together provide the mapping and management of style data onto document 
content in a given presentation. In 
NGLayout, style data is ultimately bound to a Frame, this Frame is a geometric 
map of a Content node in its presentation. 
<P>The NGLayout Style System was designed with 
  the goals of reasonable extensibility, high performance and a reasonable runtime 
  footprint. The current implementation 
  of the Style System is centered around mapping HTML Attributes and CSS2. 
  <BR>
  
<TABLE COLS=1 WIDTH="70%" >
<TR BGCOLOR="#FFFFCC">
<TD><B>Major Components</B></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<B>StyleSet</B>
<BR>The central management object of
the Style System is the StyleSet. The StyleSet is constructed by the UA
and passed to the PresentationShell during initialization. The UA controls
the presentation of the document by specifying which StyleSheets get applied
to the document in that presentation. Typically, the StyleSet will contain
references to the StyleSheets contained within, or linked to, the document,
as well as a collection of UA override and backstop StyleSheets. The StyleSet
also has the responsibility for creating, resolving and caching StyleContexts.
<H3>
StyleSheets and StyleRules</H3>
StyleSheets are the objects that contain
the specific style data that gets applied to the document, as well as the
logic for applying the data. Generally, the actual style data is kept in
a nsIStyleRule. The StyleSheet is responsible for determining the set of
StyleRules to apply to a given piece of content in a given situation. The
StyleRule will in turn, be told to apply its data to a given StyleContext.
<H3>
StyleContext</H3>
The StyleContext is the sum total of
style data that has been applied to a given piece of content in a given
situation. StyleContexts are created and managed by the StyleSet. Only
one StyleContext will be created for each unique stylistic situation. In
other words, all content nodes that have the identical set of StyleRules
applied to them, in the same parental context, will share one StyleContext
instance. StyleContexts contain a reference to their parent StyleContext,
a list of all the StyleRules that were applied to them, and a collection
a data structs that hold the actual, resolved style data.
<BR>
<TABLE COLS=1 WIDTH="70%" >
<TR BGCOLOR="#FFFFCC">
<TD><B>Implementation</B></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<B>NGLayout</B> 
<P>The NGLayout side of the Style System consists 
  of the StyleSet, interface declarations for StyleSheets and StyleRules, the 
  StyleContext, and specific style data structures contained within the StyleContext. 
<P><B>StyleSet</B>
<BR>In addition to implementing the
storage of StyleSheets (an ordered set). The StyleSet implements the basic
StyleContext resolution algorithm.

<P>To establish a StyleContext, the
StyleSet is passed three items: a pointer to the current Presentation Context,
a pointer to the Frame that will contain the StyleContext, and a pointer
to the Content node (or pseudo content) that style is being mapped for.
Given this data, the StyleSet follows the following algorithm: first the
parent frame is given an opportunity to return a cached StyleContext for
the Content. The implementation of that caching is Frame dependent and
should be used carefully. Failing to obtain a cached StyleContext, the
StyleSet then iterates all the StyleSheets, collecting from them a list
of StyleRules to apply to that Content in that Frame. Determining what
rules apply is a StyleSheet specific behavior, however, the rules are returned
in order of precedence.

<P>Once a set of StyleRules is established,
the StyleSet attempts to find an already established StyleContext that
uses the exact set of StyleRules with the same parent StyleContext (from
the parent Frame). If an established StyleContext isn't found, a new instance
is finally created. This instance then processes its set of StyleRules
to determine the actual style data for that StyleContext.
<H4>
StyleContext</H4>
The StyleContext contains a collection of StyleStructs. 
These structs hold the actual style data that is needed for the layout, rendering 
and operation of a NGLayout document. The collection of structs is extensible, 
and individual structs are queried for by ID. The set of structs implemented in 
NGLayout is a sum of that needed to handle HTML and XML documents with CSS applied. 
<P>When a StyleContext is created, first
all style data is initialized to starting values. Inheritable attributes
are copied from the parent context, then the StyleRules are iterated in
reverse order (so that higher precedence data is set last). Each StyleRule
gets passed the StyleContext and PresentationContext, and then maps its
data into the StyleContext's data structs.

<P><B>CSS</B>

<P>The handling of CSS data in NGLayout is 
  achieved by a custom parser, StyleSheet and StyleRule class. The parser is invoked 
  during document load for each CSS StyleSheet encountered, it produces a CSSStyleSheet 
  object that contains all the StyleRules and child StyleSheets (from @import 
  rules). The StyleSheet contains the StyleRules and sorts them according to CSS 
  cascading order. The StyleRules contain the Selectors and Declarations. 
  <BR>
  When the StyleSheet is asked for
a list of StyleRules for a given Content node in a given Frame. It searches
through its list of StyleRules applying the CSS Selector algorithm to determine
which StyleRules apply.

<P>The StyleRules, when asked to map their 
  data into a StyleContext, simply convert from CSS data into the simplified NGLayout 
  data stored in the StyleContext. 
<P><B>HTML</B>

<P>The HTML StyleSheet class in NGLayout serves 
  as an adapter between HTML Attributes and the Style System. The StyleSheet contains 
  no data, the actual Attributes are stored by each HTML Content node in a special 
  class. This class, nsHTMLAttributes, contains a list of all the Attributes for 
  a Content node, and also implements the StyleRule interface. 
<P>When a HTML StyleSheet is asked for
a list of StyleRules for a given piece of Content, it simply asks the Content
if it has any Attributes. If so, the Attribute class is returned as a StyleRule.
If the Content has a STYLE attribute, then a second rule is returned for
the contents of that Attribute.

<P>When the Attributes are asked to map their 
  data into a StyleContext, a method of the Content, MapAttributesInto, is invoked 
  to allow the Content node to interpret its Attributes and convert them to NGLayout 
  style data. <BR>
  
<TABLE COLS=1 WIDTH="70%" >

<TD><B>Dependencies</B></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
The NGLayout Style System is heavily dependent 
on the Content and Frame models. The whole notion of StyleContexts is based on 
applying style to Content that is mapped into a Frame model. See Layout documentation 
for more details there. <BR>

<TD><B>Roadmap</B></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<LI>
Flushing out implementation of CSS &amp;
HTML attributes.</LI>

<UL>The set of style attributes implemented
so far has been driven by dependencies on the Style System from implementations
of Layout and Rendering behavior.
<BR>The short term goal is to flush
out all the attributes that need to be stored in a StyleContext.</UL>

<LI>
CSS Pseudo-element &amp; pseudo-class
support.</LI>

<UL>Pseudo-elements will be implemented
by style support for Pseudo-Frames (see Layout docs). This will require
some extensions to the Style Resolution apis, since there won't be an actual
Content node to be mapped. Pseudo-class support will be implemented in
the CSS StyleSheet by extending the Selector match algorithm to account
for document state.</UL>

<LI>
Style mapping performance</LI>

<UL>Several performance aspects have
yet to be implemented: the first level cache of StyleContexts by Frames,
CSS Selector matching and possible special handling of the UA StyleSheet.
<BR>The CSS Selector matching algorithm
currently searches through all StyleRules in the StyleSheet. This will
be reduced by pre-sorting the StyleRules by Tag, Class and ID.

  <P>The UA StyleSheet used in NGLayout is currently 
    a CSS StyleSheet. Since UA processing doesn't need full CSS support to implement 
    backward compatible behavior, we may implement a third StyleSheet class to 
    special case the UA behavior with increased performance.
</UL>

<LI>
DOM support</LI>

<UL>The CSS StyleSheet and StyleRules
classes need to be connected to the DOM implementation. This will involve
flushing out the DOM apis for CSS, as well as guaranteeing correct behavior
of the System when style data changes.</UL>

<LI>
Full CSS2 support</LI>

<UL>At this point we'll be going through
the CSS2 spec with a fine-toothed comb and making sure that all desired
behaviors are implemented.</UL>

<LI>
Full HTML support</LI>

<UL>Here we'll be going though the Content
model and ensuring that all Attributes are present and accounted for.</UL>

</TABLE>

<UL>
<LI>
CSS Selector matching performance is
known to be an issue, but that's because we haven't gotten there yet.</LI>

<LI>
Many style attributes have only been
implemented to a limited degree to date. Furthermore, layout and rendering
code isn't completely implemented to interpret all possible values.</LI>
