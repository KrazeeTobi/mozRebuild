<h1>Mozilla Window Issues</h1>
<p align="right"> 28 Apr 99<br>
<a href="mailto:danm@netscape.com">contact</a></p>
<p>A list of known problems, and on occasion, solutions, regarding windows in 
  Mozilla.</p>
<h2>Change history</h2>
<p class="history">28 Apr 99 - Added two new issues: modal window posing and data 
  I/O.</p>
<h2>Chrome is content</h2>
<p>Window chrome is treated like HTML content: it's parsed and built and handled 
  by the same layout engine using the same rules. The resulting boons to design 
  and usability are well discussed. Several problems follow from this approach, 
  described in this section and others.</p>
<p>A window's chrome cannot be loaded immediately or synchronously. This causes 
  difficulties in, for instance, deciding on the return value from JavaScript's 
  window.open call, since the content webshell is created asynchronously.</p>
<p>Without explicit protection from each other, Java, JavaScript and plugins in 
  the content and chrome webshells can access each other. See also <a href="#security">Security</a>.</p>
<h3>Solutions</h3>
<p>window.open should create and return a content webshell immediately. This webshell 
  must be cached and later substituted for the actual main content webshell when 
  the proper placement for that object is discovered in the chrome description. 
  The first part of this two-step solution has been implemented at time of writing.</p>
<h2>Timing of EndDocumentLoad</h2>
<p>There is processing to be done once a document has been loaded. This is code 
  normally found in places like <code>onload</code> event handlers. For chrome 
  documents, widgets and command structures must be initialized and hooked up. 
  HTML documents have varied requirements unique to their documents.</p>
<p>This processing is triggered by the receipt of an &quot;on connections complete&quot; 
  event. Separate events should be received for the chrome and content. There 
  is some debate about the proper timing of these events. In the simple case of 
  a browser window with one content area, it would obviously be preferable for 
  the chrome final initialization to happen without first waiting for the HTML 
  content to load. Mailnews, on the other hand, have subchrome documents they'd 
  like initialized before the superchrome is initialized. Before implementing 
  an initialization model, we must first decide which is best. </p>
<h3>Solutions</h3>
<p>Webshells propagate the EndDocumentLoad event to their containers, so it seems 
  the question of order can be solved by finishing loading the outermost chrome 
  first, and making its handlers able to put off handling of as-yet incomplete 
  subchrome. They'll be notified again when the subchrome has loaded.</p>
<p>As for the more interesting issue, the content webshell should be initially 
  loaded empty; a load of its contents being fired during handling of the chrome's 
  EndDocumentLoad event. This neatly separates the loading of the chrome and content 
  documents, and ensures correct loading order.</p>
<p>I believe no one is working on this issue at time of writing, though the entire 
  handling of a XUL document's EndDocumentLoad event is currently being brought 
  into line with Gecko's general model currently implemented for XML and HTML 
  documents.</p>
<h2><a name="webshellhierarchy"></a>Chrome contains content</h2>
<p>The outermost webshell (JavaScript &quot;window&quot;) of a browser window 
  contains chrome, not HTML content. Loading content into the topmost webshell 
  is an operation which has been taken by the scripting model in all previous 
  browsers to mean replacing the entire contents of a window. In Mozilla, it means 
  replacing the chrome.</p>
<h2>Ambiguity in the meaning of &quot;content&quot;</h2>
<p>Historical APIs expect a browser window to contain exactly one content area. 
  window.open takes an URL for this content as its single most important parameter. 
  In the new world, a browser window can have no content at all (though arguably 
  it could hardly be called a <i>browser</i> then), or several.</p>
<h2><a name="idregistry"></a>Chrome content ID registry</h2>
<p>Though the exact contents of a browser window's chrome is highly variable, 
  legacy APIs and ease of use demand an interface whereby certain well-known features 
  expected to be in the chrome of a usable browser window can be accessed. A script 
  can request a window without a location bar, for instance. And the generic window 
  loading code to which we aspire has a need to know whether the XUL content it's 
  handed happens to contain a location bar.</p>
<h3>Solutions</h3>
<p>Part of Mozilla's responsibility in creating XUL will need to be the definition 
  and (at least in the short term) maintenance of a registry of IDs for well-known 
  chrome elements. Application components can query the chrome for features using 
  these IDs when locating the appropriate widget to carry out UI operations.</p>
<p>The browser window will need well-known IDs only for its well-known scriptable 
  chrome features: <code>toolbar</code>, <code>location</code>, <code>status</code> 
  and <code>menubar</code>. It may never require an effort more ambitious than 
  the simple documentation of IDs for these four widgets. But other application 
  interfaces may have greater requirements, and plugin implementors may concern 
  themselves with these details. It would be useful to support a registry for 
  these things.</p>
<h2>JavaScript backwards compatibility</h2>
<p>Historical JavaScript allowed chrome features to be specified and queried through 
  a list of flags. For instance, the personal toolbar and location field were 
  controllable this way, as were widgets not strictly part of the chrome content, 
  such as scrollbars and the resize widget. These chrome elements are now completely 
  specified in the XUL used to open the window. Not only is it unclear how to 
  specify the chrome corresponding to these programmatic flags (separate XUL files 
  for the 128 possible combinations seems like the wrong way, and probably causes 
  problems with the <a href="#shareddom">shared DOM</a>), but it is also unclear 
  how to ask the chrome, once built, which chrome features it contains. See <a href="#idregistry">chrome 
  content ID registry</a> for a likely solution.</p>
<p>window.open is a particular nuisance: it takes an URL describing the browser 
  content as its single content parameter. We must continue to support this syntax, 
  while we need the ability to specify first the chrome URL, and then one or more 
  content URLs.</p>
<p>See also <a href="#webshellhierarchy">Chrome contains content</a>.</p>
<h2>Threading</h2>
<p>The whole issue of multiple simultaneous windows, some of them alerts in response 
  to netlib requests, in a single-threaded environment is such a musclebound, 
  lion-eating snake it can hardly be described.</p>
<p>One associated problem follows from our single-threaded, mostly non-reentrant 
  UI. Layout will attempt to completely finish drawing one window before progressing 
  to another. This implies usability annoyances with multiple main (&quot;browser&quot;) 
  windows, and far greater problems from using the same engine to draw dialogs 
  and alerts which may arise during browser window layout.</p>
<h3>Solutions</h3>
<p>Layout will be made <i>reentrant</i>, which will make layout-driven alert dialogs 
  not impossible.</p>
<h2>Modal Dialogs</h2>
<p>Dialogs which stop execution of the calling function until the user interaction 
  with the dialog has been completed pose special problems with our application 
  architecture. Stopping a function while running the dialog poses some problem. 
  A dialog must operate on its own thread, or the primordial thread, on Windows, 
  at least. This is a problem in Mozilla since though the UI itself is single-threaded, 
  the entire application is not.</p>
<h3>Solutions</h3>
<p>Stopping a function's execution while a modal dialog runs should be possible 
  using captive event loops. This should work nicely on Windows and Macintosh, 
  since the OS on these platforms generally codes modal dialogs coded just this 
  way. Whether this approach will work on unices is currently under investigation.</p>
<h2>Dialog Data I/O</h2>
<p>Moving data into and out of dialogs turns out to be problematic, and several 
  solutions are being implemented. This may itself be a problem. By dialog I/O, 
  we mean setting the initial control values at dialog creation and querying the 
  same control settings during dialog dismissal. Modeless dialogs are not a real 
  concern: they are just windows and already need to have some way to reflect 
  control changes in the larger application by their nature as a live palette 
  of controls.</p>
<p>Modal dialogs require a convenient point to initialize control settings before 
  the dialog is displayed, and to notify the caller of their control settings 
  after the window has been dismissed. We are considering several possibilities.</p>
<h3>Solutions</h3>
<p>JavaScript <code>onload</code> handlers and event handlers for the dismissal 
  buttons are convenient points to move data in and out of the window at the appropriate 
  times. The issue of <i>where</i> to move the data from or to remains. <code>window.opener</code>, 
  the parent window, will often be the right choice. AppCores or (soon) scriptable 
  services; drop-off points into the C++ code, are also good candidates. The C++ 
  version of JavaScript event handlers is DOM event listeners.</p>
<p>A second solution for data input under consideration is encoding of data at 
  the end of the URL for the dialog contents in much the same way as CGI programs 
  expect data from <code>method=GET</code> forms. Any collision between this re-use 
  of the same data passing mechanism, should such a dialog itself be the result 
  of CGI output, would be expected to be resolved by both the CGI program and 
  the dialog initialization code each using unique parameter names.</p>
<p>Another JavaScript solution for data I/O under consideration is the addition 
  of a new parameter to the <code>window.open</code> call -- probably added to 
  a new <code>window.opendialo</code>g call since the last parameter to <code>window.open</code> 
  is already a variable-value placeholder. This new parameter would be an array 
  of variant values which the caller and dialog are free to interpret as they 
  like. </p>
<h2><a name="security"></a>Security</h2>
<p>I believe it can be safely stated even by holders of the most liberal model 
  of content and chrome interaction that the chrome requires some protection from 
  the content. The chrome and content webshells require insulation from each other 
  not provided by the default JavaScript model.</p>
<h2><a name="shareddom"></a>Shared, persistent chrome DOM</h2>
<p>Our implementation of XUL content shares a single in-memory DOM between all 
  windows with content from the same URL, and changes to this DOM will be persistent, 
  or at least persistible. This is just a point to keep in mind when designing 
  implementations. The act of making changes to a chrome DOM may have unexpected 
  side effects.</p>
<h2>Embedded Gecko</h2>
<p>Gecko has needs for presenting UI outside its immediate content area, as alerts 
  and dialogs, particularly for questions posed by netlib. As an applications 
  team, we have been designing these dialogs to be fulfilled by application components, 
  assuming the runtime presence of features not likely to be present in an embedded 
  implementation. XUL for window content description and appshells for running 
  the windows come to mind.</p>
<p>Applications believe this is the right path for them, though it leaves Gecko 
  without a packaged solution. This is an issue to be resolved.</p>
