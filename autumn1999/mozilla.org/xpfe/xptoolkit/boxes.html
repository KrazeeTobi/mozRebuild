         interpretation of how boxes work. If I'm wrong about
         anything, please bring it to my attention. You may have
         discovered a bug in boxes, or I may have misinterpreted
         something. - Dave&#93;</FONT></P>

         <H3>The Basics</H3>
         
         <P>The box is a special kind of container used primarily for
         laying out controls within dialogs and windows. Boxes lay
         out their children using a constraint-based system in which
         both relative sizing and intrinsic sizing of controls are
         supported. Boxes are ideal for a layout in which the size of
         the controls could change (e.g., because of localization
         changes or skin changes).</P>
         
         <P>The box is specified using the
         <FONT COLOR="#008000">box</FONT> tag. Boxes come in two
         flavors: the horizontal box and the vertical box. The
         horizontal box lays out its children horizontally (left to
         right), and the vertical box stacks its children vertically
         (top to bottom).</P>
         
         <P>The <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">align</FONT> attribute can be
         used to dictate whether or not the box is horizontal or
         vertical. If the <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">align</FONT>
         attribute is omitted, the box is assumed to be
         horizontal.</P>

         </P>
         
         <P>When items are placed in a box without specifying any
         additional information about their size, then the box will
         flow the children <I>intrinsically</I>. In other words, the
         box will ask each child how big its needs to be, and then it
         will make the child that size. Notice that in the above
         example, the two buttons are only as big as they need to be
         to display all of their text.</P>
         
         <P>Widths can be specified for items inside a horizontal
         box. When an object specifies its width in pixels or in ems,
         it is telling the box that it would like to be that width.
         Percentage widths are meaningless inside a horizontal box.
         Similarly, heights can be specified for items in a vertical
         box. The component is indicating its preferred height.
         Percentage heights are likewise meaningless inside a
         vertical box.</P>
         
         <P>It is generally the case that specifying percentage
         widths or heights on children of a box (regardless of its
         alignment) is meaningless and should be avoided.
         <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">&#91;In fact, it currently appears
         that such a specification can cause problems, so make sure
         that if you're using boxes, you don't use percentage widths
         and heights on the direct children of the
         box.&#93;</FONT></P>

         <P>An object becomes flexible when the
         <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">flex</FONT> attribute is placed on the
         element. Objects that are flexible can shrink or grow as the
         box shrinks and grows. Whenever there is extra space left
         over in a box, the flexible objects are expanded to fill
         that space. Flex is specified as a numerical value. All flex
         is relative. For example, a child with a flex of 2 is twice
         as flexible as a child with a flex of 1.</P>
         
         <P>Let's take a look at what happens with flexible objects
         when there is extra space left over.</P>

         </TABLE>
         </P>
         
         <P>In the above example, the box is 200 pixels tall, which
         is more than enough room for the three buttons. Because the
         first and third buttons are inflexible, they remain the same
         size as in the previous example. The second button is
         specified as being flexible, and because it is the only
         flexible object in the box, it receives all of the extra
         space.</P>
         
         <P>When several objects in a box are flexible, the extra
         space is divided among the objects based on how flexible
         they are. The box determines how much space to give an
         object by adding up the flex values on all of its children.
         An object gets an amount of extra space equal to the
         percentage of flex that it is responsible for.</P>
         
         <P>For example, if two objects have a flex of 1, then the
         first object gets 1/(1+1) = 1/2 of the extra space, and the
         second object also gets 1/2 of the extra space.</P>

         <H3>Preferred, Minimum, and Maximum Sizes</H3>
         
         <P>For inflexible objects, the specification of the
         <FONT COLOR="#800080">width</FONT> and
         <FONT COLOR="#800080">height</FONT> properties can be used
         to hardcode an object's size. If they are omitted, an
         inflexible object will be sized intrinsically.</P>
         
         <P>With flexible objects, there are more options. Just as
         with inflexible objects, the
         <FONT COLOR="#800080">width</FONT> and
         <FONT COLOR="#800080">height</FONT> properties can be used
         to specify a preferred size. However, unlike inflexible
         objects, this size is only a guideline. The box code will
         stretch a flexible object as it sees fit. It will also
         shrink the object if required until the object can shrink no
         more (e.g., when the object hits its minimum required
         intrinsic size).</P>

         </TABLE>
         </P>
         
         <P>In the above example the box is shrinking, and despite
         the specification of 1000 pixels as the preferred height,
         the button, because it is flexible, shrinks with the box. It
         continues to shrink until the minimum required height for
         the button is reached. After that, the button can shrink no
         further. If the box were to continue to shrink, the button's
         contents would be clipped, and a portion of the button would
         no longer be visible.</P>
         
         <P>Components can therefore have their own notions of
         minimum and maximum intrinsic sizes. For example, the titled
         button was smart enough to know that it could not get any
         smaller than the minimum height required to draw its borders
         and its text.</P>
         
         <P>For a more fine-grained control of minimum and maximum
         sizes, the <FONT COLOR="#800080">min-width</FONT>,
         <FONT COLOR="#800080">min-height</FONT>,
         <FONT COLOR="#800080">max-width</FONT>, and
         <FONT COLOR="#800080">max-height</FONT> properties can be
         used. When specified, they provide extra information to the
         box as it shrinks and grows the object in question.</P>
         
         <P>In a horizontal box, for example, if a minimum width is
         specified, then the flexible object will not be allowed to
         shrink below that width. If a maximum width is specified,
         then the flexible object will not be allowed to grow beyond
         that width.</P>

         <FONT COLOR="#800080">max-height</FONT> in action. In the
         first screenshot the box has been shrunk until it is smaller
         than 100 pixels in height. Because the iframe has a
         specified minimum height of 100 pixels, it is not allowed to

         <H3>Nesting Boxes</H3>
         
         <P>It may help to remember that regardless of the kind of
         child you place inside a box, the above basic rules continue
         to apply. When a box is placed inside another box, it's no
         different than placing anything else inside the box. Like
         any other children of a box, a nested box is either flexible
         or inflexible. When inflexible it will size itself
         intrinsically if no widths or heights are specified on it.
         If the size is specified on an inflexible child, the child
         box will be that size.</P>
         
         <P>The whole concept of boxes is that they are a very simple
         atomic layout managers. By themselves that are not that
         powerful but when nested you can achieve some complex
         layouts. Take this example.</P>

         <P>In the above example the titled button is centered in the
         middle of the window. This is achieved by creating a
         horizontal box and putting a vertical box inside it. The
         vertical box contains a titledbutton. The magic here is how
         the vertical box and horizontal box are centered. This is
         done by using an invisible component called a
         <FONT COLOR="#008000">spring</FONT>. (A spring is nothing
         special. In CSS it is just a block frame, akin to a
         <FONT COLOR="#008000">div</FONT> in HTML).) By placing
         flexible springs before and after the vertical box and
         before and after the titled button we get a centering
         effect.</P>

         <H3>Intrinsic Sizing of Windows and Dialogs</H3>
         
         <P>When windows and dialogs are opened in XUL, unless you
         specify a width and height for the window (see <A HREF="windows.html">Windows
         and Dialogs</A>), the window will intrinsically size itself
         around its content.</P>
         
         <P>In XUL the outermost <FONT COLOR="#008000">window</FONT>
         tag is a horizontal box. It behaves in every respect like
         the <FONT COLOR="#008000">box</FONT> tag. It can be turned
         into a vertical box by using the
         <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">align</FONT> attribute.</P>
         
         <P>Through careful use of boxes, dialogs can be designed so
         that they come up as big as they need to be but no bigger.
         Such a design is handy for dialogs whose appearance might
         change (thus necessitating a size change) because of a
         different skin or different locale (see <A HREF="packages.html">Packages</A>).</P>
         
         <P>There are certain caveats when building intrinsically
         sized dialogs. The following rules are guidelines to help
         ensure that you are using boxes correctly.</P>
         
         <P>&nbsp;</P>
         
         <UL>
            <LI><B>Don't specify percentage widths and heights on
            objects that are direct children of boxes.</B> It is
            meaningless to do so. If you want to specify relative
            flexibility (e.g., one object takes up 20% of the space,
            and the other object takes up 80%), you can do so using
            flex (e.g., flex="20" and flex="80").
            
            <P>&nbsp;</P></LI>
            
            <LI><B>Constrain the width of
            </B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><B>html:div</B></FONT><B> tags
            used inside boxes.</B> Divs are nothing more than blocks
            of text. When sizing intrinsically, if the width of the
            div is not constrained, all the text will run together on
            one line. Be careful in general about using paragraphs of
            text in dialogs and windows. If you need to do so, make
            sure you place a cap on the width of the div (max-width
            is good for this).
            
            <P>&nbsp;</P></LI>
            
            <LI><B>Be careful about using percentage width/height in
            windows.</B> If you provide no hints regarding maximum
            size, and only specify rules in terms of percentages,
            you're asking for trouble. 50% of infinity (an
            unconstrained width) is still infinity. If your dialogs
            are coming up really tall or really wide, you're probably
            guilty of this. You're probably specifying percentages
            when you should be using flex instead.</LI>

         <H3>Visual Debugging</H3>
         
         <P>Boxes support visual debugging that allows you see and
         query their layout. This is extremely useful when trying to
         debug a troublesome UI.</P>
         
         <P><A HREF="boxdebug.xul">Example</A> (viewable with
         Mozilla)</P>
         
         <PRE>&lt;box debug="true" align="horizontal" flex="1"&gt;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;titledbutton value="flexible button1" flex="1"/&gt;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;titledbutton value="fixed button1"/&gt;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;box align="vertical" flex="1"&gt;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;titledbutton value="flexible button1" flex="1"/&gt;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;titledbutton value="flexible button1" flex="2"/&gt;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;titledbutton value="fixed button1"/&gt;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/box&gt;<BR>&lt;/box&gt;</PRE>
         
         <P>Visual debugging can turned on by setting the attribute
         &igrave;debug=true on a element in the document. If the
         element is a box or contains boxes, the boxes show up
         visually. Horizontal boxes are drawn in blue and have
         springs/struts stretched across the tops of their children.
         Vertical boxes are red and have their springs/struts to the
         left of their children. Each spring/strut represents the
         min, preferred, and max sizes as well as the flexibility of
         its child. If the child&iacute;s flexibility is 0 the box
         will show a strut for it. If the flexibility is greater than
         0 the box will draw a spring for it. This allows you to
         visually see how dialog can stretch.. Try resizing the
         example above. Notice how flexible children take up space
         while fixed ones do not.</P>
         
         <H4>Querying the spring/strut</H4>
         
         <P>The min, max, pref, and flexibility can easily be
         displayed by bringing the console window to the front and
         moving the mouse over any spring or strut. The following
         information is displayed to the console:</P>
         
         <PRE>FrameType(tag): min(width&#91;CSS&#93;,height), pref(width, height), max(width,height), flex(1.000)</PRE>
         
         <P>FrameType: This is the type of frame used to display the
         child.<BR>
         Tag: This is the tag of the child. Ex (div, titledbutton,
         etc)<BR>
         Min: The minimum width and height this child can be sized
         to.<BR>
         Pref: The preferred size the child would like to be.<BR>
         Max: the maximum size the child can be. (INF means no
         limit)<BR>
         Flex: The child&iacute;s flexibility (if it&iacute;s 0 its a
         strut)</P>
         
         <P>&#91;CSS&#93;: To the right of any value: width,height an
         optional CSS flag can appear. This indicates that this value
         was redefined via CSS or as and attribute on the tag itself.
         For example:</P>
         
         <PRE>titiledbutton {<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; min-width: 100px;<BR>}
&lt;box debug="true"&gt;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;titledbutton flex="1" value="foo"/&gt;<BR>&lt;/box&gt;</PRE>
         
         <P>If you were to move over the spring for the titledbutton
         you might get this:</P>
         
         <PRE>nsTitledButtonFrame(titledbutton): min(100&#91;CSS&#93;, 50), pref(50,50), max(INF,INF), flex(1.000)</PRE>
         
         <P>Indicating that the min-width was redefined to be 100px
         in CSS.</P>
