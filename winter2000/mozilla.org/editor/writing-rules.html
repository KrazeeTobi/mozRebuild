<h1>
Writing Your Own Ender HTML Typing Rules</h1></center>

<p>
A brief tour into how to create and use a different rules system in
Ender, such as it is.

<p>
First, note that the rules system architecture is not mature.  There is
just enough there to encourage us, as developers, to separate out the
rules oriented code well enough so that we don't get hosed in the future
when we want alternate rules systems.

<p>
The rules system interface is not XPCOMified at the moment.  We may do
that in the future.  In the meantime, one of the consequences is that
all rules code needs to be linked against the editor.  The easiest way
to do that is just to include the rules as part of the editor dll
itself.  So rules aren't plugable right now, though again, that could
be changed.

<p>
There are two rules systems, one for the text-only editor and one for
the html editor.  The latter is oriented towards mail compose at the
moment.  The implementation for these rules systems are in
nsTextEditRules.cpp and nsHTMLEditRules.cpp, respectively.

<p>
Every instantiation of an editor has it's own rules object. 
nsTextEditor and nsHTMLEditor both have an InitRules() function which
handles this.  Until we make rules plugin at the runtime level, you will
have to settle for plugging them in programmatically by altering the
InitRules() method of nsHTMLEditor to use your rules system instead.

<p>
For every call into the editor that might want different behavior
depending on your rules, there is a corresponding "code sandwich".  The
routine will call

<blockquote><code>
mRules->WillDoAction(..., *aCancel);
</code></blockquote>

<p>
If aCancel is true, the routine will not perform the action itself, it
was handled by the rules system.  Otherwise, the routine will perform
the default version of the action, and then will call:

<blockquote><code>
mRules->DidDoAction(...)
</code></blockquote>

<p>
giving the rules system a chance to do any post processing it wants.

<p>
Take a look at nsHTMLEditorRules.cpp to see the signature for
WillDoAction()/DidDoAction(), and how they might be used.

<p>
There is an extra informational structure passed throughout the code
sandwich which is a complete hack at the moment - just a glom of
whatever is needed by any of the rules.  A better way of bundling extra
info for the benefit of rules should be written - something that will
allow arbitrary tuples of {name of info, the info} to be passed through.

<p>
In order to understand much of the rules code, you will have to
understand several building block technologies that are in the editor or
layout.  These include:

<ul>
<li>The DOM and the Content model (nsIDOMNode and nsIContent) 
<li>Ranges (nsIDOMRange) 
<li>Selection (nsIDOMSelection) 
<li>Content Iterators (nsIContentIterator) 
<li>Editor helper functionality (in nsEditor.cpp at the moment) 
<li>The Transaction manager
</ul>

<p>
I'll go over some of these very briefly.

<h2>
The DOM and the Content model (nsIDOMNode and nsIContent)
</h2>

<p>
For info on these see: <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/newlayout/dom-roadmap.htm">http://www.mozilla.org/newlayout/dom-roadmap.html</a>
and <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/newlayout/doc/contentmodel.html">http://www.mozilla.org/newlayout/doc/contentmodel.html</a>.

<h2>
Ranges (nsIDOMRange)
</h2>

<p>
Ranges are pretty straightforward, and are a way of specifying an
arbitrary span of a DOM tree.  A range has a startpoint and an endpoint,
which are both tuples of {parent, offset}.  The only tricky parts are:

<p>
* in start/endpoints that are inside text nodes the offset refers to
where in the actual character data the range start/end is, while in
non-textnodes the offset specifies between which child nodes of the
parent the range starts/ends.

<p>
* ranges move around under content manipulation.  How this happens is
all spelled out in the range specification at:
http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-DOM-Level-2/range.html It's important to
understand this "DOM gravity" aspect of ranges, because selection is
implemented in terms of ranges, and you will often need to understand
how content modifications may affect the selection in order to properly
deal with this in editor transactions.

<h2>
Selection (nsIDOMSelection)
</h2>

<p>
We don't have a good selection doc that I know of right now.  Mike has
been doomed to writing and rewriting selection and has done a great job
with it.

<p>
Maybe he can chip in here.  Take a look at nsIDOMSelection and remember
that selection objects are made up of a list of ranges - ie, you might
have several non-overlapping ranges making up one selection.  I know of
no way to actually get more than one range right now, but you should
code as if there are a list of them.

<h2>
Content Iterators (nsIContentIterator)
</h2>

<p>
We don't have any kind of content iterator doc right now.

<p>
The basic idea with the iterators is to try to put into one place the
code needed to navigate, left to right or right to left, over an
arbitrary range in the content tree.  At the moment the iterators
default to post-order, or what I call "close tag order".  Ie, you get
parents after children, and you only get parents if the range includes
the "end" of the parent, ie if it included the close tag, if you think
of it in terms of the html stream.

<p>
There are two types of iterators, the content iterator and the subtree 
iterator.

<p>
The content iterator does what you'd expect and will iterate over
every node in the range.  They are used, directly or indirectly, by much
of the rules code.

<p>
The subtree iterator iterator is like the content iterator, but in any
situation where the content iterator would have returned both a node and
that nodes parent somewhere along the way, the subtree iterator will
only return the parent.  The original inspiration for the subtree
iterator was to do efficient deletion over a range: if you remove the
parent of some node you obviously didn't need to remove it's children. 
It turns out this kind of iterator is useful in selection as well. 
Perhaps it will be useful in some rules code someday.

<h2>
Editor helper functionality (in nsEditor.cpp at the moment)
</h2>

<p>
There is a bunch of utility code already written for doing many of the
kinds of things frequently needed when writing rules code.  Check out
nsEditor.cpp and also nsHTMLEditor.cpp for a host of helper routines.  
There is a document floating around (get Steve to put it up on Mozilla) 
on Block Transformation functions.  In the future I hope to document the 
various utility functions, but for now the source and comments are the 
documentation.  There is a lot of duplication in the utility functions 
that is slowly getting cleaned up.  

<h2>
The Transaction Manager
</h2>

<p>
There is a good doc on this at http://www.mozilla.org/editor/undo.html.
Note the use in the editor of BeginTransaction() / EndTransaction(), 
which are used to make sure a series of actions gets grouped together 
for undo purposes, and also disables some drawing while a transaction is 
in progress.
