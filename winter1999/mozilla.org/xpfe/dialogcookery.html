<h2>Scope</h2>
<p>This document is not intended to be a comprehensive syntax or reference manual. 
  At the moment it's an apology for the current state of things, and a design 
  document. With care and time, it should grow into a useful starting place for 
  making windows and writing dialogs. The <a href="mailto:danm@netscape.com">author</a> 
  thinks that feedback on what's missing from the document would help build a 
  better document, so the quality of this thing is in the reader's hands. Keep 
  that in mind while you're cursing me.</p>
<p>In the meantime, this document also serves as a roadmap of XPFE's dialog story. 
  Interested parties would please review it to determine whether the package we 
  plan to deliver will meet their needs.</p>
<h2>Direction</h2>
<p>Current XPFE design goals state that dialogs get no special treatment; they're 
  just windows like any other. Windows can have parent windows, and be displayed 
  modally, and have control callbacks, and so behave like dialogs. But our goal 
  is that the same application code that instantiates a browser window will serve 
  equally to instantiate a dialog window. The difference lies in the window content, 
  and a couple of parameters controlling modality and that sort of thing.</p>
<h2>JavaScript vs C++</h2>
<p>Currently, all window control mechanisms flow through JavaScript. That is, 
  any capabilities a window may have besides taking up space on the desktop are 
  specified in the XUL describing the window, and the binding between the window 
  content and the application is done through JavaScript in the XUL. That binding 
  can be very short: it can fall through to application C code very quickly, but 
  JavaScript will be part of the process. (Note that we have not yet run into 
  any threading problems with this model, but we kind of expect to.)</p>
<p>JavaScript is easily added to a window: just include it in the XUL window description 
  and follow a short but peculiar dance to hook it up. Hooking up C code involves 
  writing a C++/JavaScript interface, and calling it from JavaScript. That interface 
  is an AppCore, and there's a separate and much more impressive <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/xpfe/appCore/appcores.html">document</a> 
  describing them and explaining how to build them.</p>
<h2>Make a Window</h2>
<p>So, there are two ways to make a window or dialog: directly through C++ and 
  from JavaScript. The resulting window is an instance of <code>nsWebShellWindow</code>. 
  This means it currently contains a hulking bunch of hackery for hooking up browser-window 
  specific contents. This will be cleaned up in the future.</p>
<p>Note there is currently no way to make a modal dialog or alert. We are limited 
  to simply bringing up new XUL windows at this time. Also note that windows are 
  not sized to content. These are merely somewhat glorified browser windows, to 
  which automatically sizing themselves to match their content is something of 
  an eyebrow-furrowing concept. Specifying the size of a dialog is another future 
  enhancement. </p>
<h3>C++</h3>
<p>The C++ interface is <code>nsIAppShellService::CreateDialogWindow()</code>. 
  It's currently very clunky and will change (you'll see that statement many times 
  in this document). But at time of writing, you create a new window like this:</p>
<pre><code>
  nsresult              rv;
  nsString              controllerCID;
  nsIAppShellService    *appShell;
  nsIURL                *url;
  nsIWidget             *parent, *window;
  nsIStreamObserver     *observer;
  nsIXULWindowCallbacks *callbacks;
  PRInt32               width, height;

  window = nsnull;
  rv = nsServiceManager::GetService(kAppShellServiceCID,
         kIAppShellServiceIID,
         (nsISupports**) &appShell);
  if (NS_SUCCEEDED(rv)) {
    controllerCID = "43147b80-8a39-11d2-9938-0080c7cb1081";
    appShell->CreateTopLevelWindow(parent, url, controllerCID,
                window, observer, callbacks, width, height);
    nsServiceManager::ReleaseService(kAppShellServiceCID,
                appShell);
  }
  if (window != nsnull)
    window->Show(PR_TRUE);</code></pre>
<p>At time of writing, only <code>url</code>, <code>window</code>, <code>observer</code> 
  and <code>callbacks</code> are actually used. <code>url</code> is an URL describing 
  the contents of the window. <code>window</code> is set to the created window. 
  See the code for descriptions of the other parameters. As I write this I become 
  all embarrassed and want to encourage people to wait for a cleaner interface.</p>
<p>There is another very similar method <code>nsIAppShellService::CreateDialogWindow()</code>. 
  It takes the same parameters and currently functions exactly the same. These 
  methods will differ only in the kind of border used on the window created. At 
  time of writing, this decision is made (the window is created) before any instructions 
  in the URL could be read and used to help make the decision.</p>
<p>At this time, window descriptions must be loaded from an URL. There will additionally 
  be methods for loading windows from a stream. In fact, XPFE want to say the 
  stream will be the preferred method, though the URL method will probably remain. 
  Streams will disengage the toolkit further from the source of the window description, 
  and will be our method for creating windows whose XUL is calculated at runtime, 
  rather than being distributed as a file.</p>
<h3>JavaScript</h3>
<p>The JavaScript interface is an AppCore named <code>ToolkitCore</code>. It behaves 
  much like the standard JavaScript <code>window.open()</code> method. In fact, 
  one might wonder why we aren't using <code>window.open()</code> directly, and 
  one would have a point. At the moment, <code>window.open()</code> doesn't seem 
  to work, and probably doesn't make an <code>nsWebShellWindow</code>. XPFE are 
  anxious to get something working, and also expect to need closer control over 
  the window-opening process. We also paled at the prospect of stepping on the 
  JavaScript windowing code. But before we're done, we will need to reconcile 
  these two rather equivalent ways of opening a window.</p>
<p>So <i>today</i>, instantiating the Toolkit AppCore in the standard way and 
  executing its window-opening method (its only method at this time) will open 
  a new <code>nsWebShellWindow</code>.</p>
<pre><code>
 function MakeDialog() {
    var toolkitCore = XPAppCoresManager.Find("ToolkitCore");
    if (!toolkitCore) {
      toolkitCore = new ToolkitCore();
      if (toolkitCore)
        toolkitCore.Init("ToolkitCore");
    }
    if (toolkitCore)
      toolkitCore.ShowWindow("resource:/res/samples/madedialog.xml",
          window);
  }</code></pre>
<p>An <code>XPAppCoresManager</code> is pre-constructed; you can access it without 
  any more preparation than shown above. <code>ToolkitCore</code> is not; it requires 
  that small bit of preparation.</p>
<h2>Load a Window</h2>
<p>Between making and showing the window, there is a callback The resulting <code>nsWebShellWindow</code> 
  comes with an associated DOM content model. Any initial control settings or 
  content changes which must be made before the window is actually shown can be 
  done at this time.</p>
<p>This callback is any JavaScript specified as the value of the <code>onConstruction</code> 
  attribute of the <code>&lt;window&gt;</code> element. In the example below, 
  the window start tag is declared</p>
<code>&lt;window ... onconstruction=&quot;Startup()&quot;&gt;</code> 
<p>During the <code>onconstruction</code> callback, dialog authors are free to 
  alter control settings from JavaScript:</p>
<pre><code>
  function Startup() {
    // yellowize and check the "ow" button
    document.bgColor = "yellow";
    var checkbox = ElementByID("ow"); // homespun function
    if (checkbox)
      checkbox.checked = true;
  }</code></pre>
<p>Except that not all properties are hooked up yet. The change to background 
  color in the example won't do anything. But the important example does work!</p>
<p>When creating a window from C code (not JavaScript), the Toolkit Appcore need 
  not be used. Additional opportunities to perform dialog preprocessing are afforded 
  by the callbacks parameter to <code>CreateTopLevelWindow</code>. Dialog preprocessing 
  can also (theoretically) be done in C by defining an AppCore, loading and calling 
  it from the <code>Startup()</code> method, as the <code>ToolkitCore</code> AppCore 
  was called to create the window. This hasn't actually been tried yet, but it 
  &quot;should be straightforward.&quot;</p>
<h2>Debrief a Window</h2>
<p>After the dialog has run -- a dismissal button has been clicked, say -- dialog 
  users will need a callback in which to query the current control settings. As 
  always, this will be done by walking the DOM content model, and accessed through 
  a JavaScript hook.</p>
<p>We are uncertain whether a specific callback need be added: the event handler 
  for the dismissal buttons may be entirely sufficient. But as the reader has 
  no doubt guessed, there is no specific debriefing hook implemented at this time.</p>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>The following XUL describes a browser window with a simple toolbar containing 
  a single button which will open another window: a nonmodal dialog, with a bit 
  of imagination.</p>
<pre><code>
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
&lt;?xml-stylesheet href=&quot;xul.css&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot;?&gt; <br>&lt;!DOCTYPE window&gt;
&lt;xul:window
    xmlns:html=&quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40&quot;
    xmlns:xul =&quot;http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul&quot;&gt;
  &lt;html:script&gt;
    function MakeDialog() {
      var toolkitCore = XPAppCoresManager.Find("ToolkitCore");
      if (!toolkitCore) {
        toolkitCore = new ToolkitCore();
        if (toolkitCore)
          toolkitCore.Init("ToolkitCore");
      }
      if (toolkitCore)
        toolkitCore.ShowWindow("resource:/res/samples/madedialog.xml",
            window);
    }
  &lt;/html:script&gt;

  &lt;xul:toolbox&gt;
    &lt;xul:toolbar&gt;
      &lt;html:button html:onclick=&quot;MakeDialog()&quot;
                   html:style=&quot;background-color:rgb(192,192,192);&quot;&gt;
        Make Dialog
      &lt;/html:button&gt;
    &lt;/xul:toolbar&gt;
  &lt;/xul:toolbox&gt;
&lt;/xul:window&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Note that only html widgets will have the expected html-specific DOM attributes 
  like &quot;checked&quot; for checkboxes. XUL buttons will respond to their own 
  APIs (to be documented in separate, dedicated papers), as well as to the core 
  DOM interfaces.</p>
<p>The above code will produce a live window with a functional button if placed 
  in a file named, perhaps, <code>makedialog.xml</code> in the <code>res/samples</code> 
  subdirectory within the directory containing <code>apprunner</code>. (Placing 
  it in that directory allows it to find the stylesheet <code>xul.css</code> mentioned 
  in the stylesheet processing instruction.) Launch <code>apprunner</code> pointing 
  at that URL to load it into the main window.</p>
<p><code>apprunner -url resource:/res/samples/makedialog.xml</code></p>
<p>A suitable dialog description XUL file (named <code>madedialog.xml</code> in 
  the above code) will be loaded when the <code>Make Dialog</code> button is pressed. 
  The following example contains the linkup code mentioned in the main body of 
  this document and has been seen to work in recent builds of the application.</p>
<p>The authors have turned a jaundiced eye toward any sense of aesthetics in the 
  design of this dialog. It's ugly. It will show up directly on top of the main 
  &quot;browser&quot; window. I plan to rely on the estimable work of a colleague 
  to provide some documentation for what sorts of visual effects can be accomplished 
  with dialog controls and provide a link to a separate document with prettier 
  samples.</p>

      &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/table&gt;

&lt;/xul:window&gt;

<p>Note the window will not be dismissed when the OK button is pressed. The current 
  state of the code will require that you hit &quot;OK&quot; and then the window 
  close box.</p>
