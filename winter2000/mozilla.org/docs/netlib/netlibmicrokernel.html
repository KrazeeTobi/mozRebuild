<b>The Netlib Microkernel Architecture</b>
<p>This document is a collection of ideas about a new direction for breaking
up netlib and allowing protocols to be built and plugged in with few requirements
on the protocol writer.
<p>The role of the new netlib core will be more clearly defined than in
the past:
<br>1. Provide registration point for protocol implementations
<br>2. Provide entry point for running commands
<br>3. Dispatch commands to appropriate registered protocol
<br>4. Create transport mechanisms for protocols upon request
<br>5. Abstract transport i/o into a stream interface
<br>6. Timeslice i/o without interfering with or requiring work from UI
thread
<p>Protocol implementations are now removed from a tight binding with the
core netlib.&nbsp; Protocol implementations will be able to communicate
with netlib through abstract stream interfaces
<p>Netlib becomes a service provider for an application that wants to build
on top of it.&nbsp; Applications must provide their own protocol implementations
which can be plugged into netlib.&nbsp; Applications run network operations
through netlib's command entry point (most likely through URLs).&nbsp;
Netlib will drive the protocols in response to those commands.
<p><b>Protocol Managers and Protocol Connections</b>
<p>Core netlib will provide a way for an application to register a protocol
implementation.&nbsp; This registration point should map a protocol scheme
("http:", "ftp:", etc.) to a Protocol Manager for a given protocol.&nbsp;
The main role of the Protocol Manager will be to create instances of Protocol
Connections.&nbsp; When a command is run through the netlib entry point,
netlib will dispatch that command to the appropriate protocol manager for
the given scheme.&nbsp; In the simplest case (maybe we can provide a default
implementation of this), the protocol manager then asks netlib to create
a "Transport" (nsITransport?) which it will hand off to a new instance
of a protocol-specific Protocol Connection.&nbsp; The nsITransport basically
is a container for an input and output stream, and possibly a control interface
for handling lower-level control issues between a protocol and the core
netlib.&nbsp; New Protocol Connections must be bound to a nsITransport
that netlib has provided, since netlib will drive the protocol connection
through the nsITransport interface.&nbsp; A more complex Protocol Manager
(for a protocol such as IMAP, for instance, which imposes restrictions
on connections, or in which connections must be maintained between commands)
can cache nsITransports after a given Protocol Connection has finished
with it.&nbsp; In this sense, the socket connection would remain open and
idle until the next time an IMAP command is run, in which case the Protocol
Manager would NOT request a new nsITransport from the core netlib;&nbsp;
it would simply reuse one from its protocol-specific connection cache.&nbsp;
The Protocol Manager may take on additional responsibilities as well, depending
on the protocol, such as queuing commands.
<p>Protocol Connections, as stated previously, are created for each instance
of an open, active connection of a given protocol.&nbsp; Protocol Connections
maintain connection-specific state, which should probably be represented
as its own contained object so that it can be registered with the Protocol
Manager if the Protocol Connection's nsITransport is later cached with
the Protocol Manager.&nbsp; Protocol Connections also contain the implementation
of the protocol-specific parser, which reads and writes to/from the stream
given in the nsITransport.&nbsp; Protocol Connections are the objects which
communicate with the application when protocol-specific events occur, such
as new data is available for an application-specific consumer.&nbsp; (See
below for more on this.)
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Threads</b>
<p>The only part of netlib running on its own thread will be the timeslicing
mechanism.&nbsp; This will cycle through open, active Transports and read/write
data between their corresponding i/o mechanisms (the socket, the file,
the memory buffer, etc.) and their streams, notifying their stream listeners
when data is available.&nbsp; This should be the only activity occurring
in the netlib thread.&nbsp; Protocol registration, command entry point
and dispatching, protocol managers and protocol connections, should all
run on the application thread (or a different thread).&nbsp; The main role
of the netlib thread is simply to isolate the process of timeslicing i/o
from the application's main event loop, so that applications can be built
without explicit knowledge of how to drive netlib.
<p>To communicate across the netlib thread into the application thread
when data is available on the socket, a proxy stream listener class will
be used which will encapsulate all threading issues.&nbsp; In this case,
neither the Tranport implementation nor the protocol implementation (very
important) need to know that they are communicating with another thread.&nbsp;
A proxy stream listener class is already built and running in the Seamonkey
tree;&nbsp; this is what is currently used to communicate from HTTP (which
right now is in the netlib thread) to raptor.&nbsp; This new design will
be moving this proxy down one level, under the protocol implementation.&nbsp;
Work will have to be done to allow protocol connections to write back across
the thread the other way.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Communication with the App from the Protocol Connections</b>
<p>Protocol Connections communicate with the application through what we
have been referring to as "event sinks," or interfaces encapsulating protocol-specific
events which can occur on a connection and which would be of interest to
the application.&nbsp; Something similar is already used today in the sense
that a protocol such as HTTP can stream out data to raptor using an nsIStreamListener
interface to notify raptor that there is new stream data.&nbsp; By making
this mechanism more generic, it is not required that this consumer be a
nsIStreamListener;&nbsp; it can be an object which may implement other
protocol-specific interfaces which can be queried by the protocol connection,
and those methods can be called to alert the application of other events.&nbsp;
Some examples of these events are other forms of out-of-band data, such
as a new folder was discovered, or a message was deleted -- things that
would have a hard time being represented as streams.
<p><b>The Socket Stub</b>
<p>From the perspective of the mail/news team, we were looking for a way
to plug our protocols into netlib and be able to communicate between the
protocols and our application at runtime.&nbsp; By laying the framework
first with a prototype, we are hoping to be able to split up from the core
netlib group and have the core group write the production-quality code
that will be behind the scenes from our perspective.&nbsp; We were hoping
to be able to start getting our protocols migrated over from the 4.5 world
into the 5.0 world in parallel to this, and for this we needed something
up and running in the core.&nbsp; The socket stub was a quick implementation
of something that might be able to provide basic testability for us, so
that we can be working in parallel while the core netlib group fleshes
out the internals.&nbsp; The socket stub simply uses the current MWContext/ActiveEntry
design to timeslice between open socket connections.&nbsp; In essence,
it is a stub protocol that simply maintains an open socket connection and
flushes data between the socket and the given streams.&nbsp; By virtue
of the fact that it uses the current MWContext/ActiveEntry design, these
connections can be intermingled with HTTP and other protocols which are
still in the old (?) architecture, and provide a migration path for new
protocols to get going.&nbsp; The socket stub was not written to be production-quality,
but rather to provide something behind the interfaces that can allow the
mail/news team to get going.&nbsp; However, in theory it might turn out
to be the case that an implementation similar to the socket stub could
be used permanently, or even temporarily, and replaced in a later release.
