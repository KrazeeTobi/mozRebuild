<p><b>Change history</b></p>
<p class="history">25 Feb 99 - Added section on case sensitivity. Embellished 
  description of filetypes, namespaces and content models, and reworked the &quot;XUL 
  Preamble&quot; section to match.</p>
<h2>Second Draft preamble</h2>

<P>Mozilla has configurable, downloadable chrome, meaning that the
arrangement and even presence or absence of controls in the main
window is not hardwired into the application, but loaded from a
separate UI description. In fact, most of Mozilla's windows (and
dialogs) will be described using this mechanism. XUL (pronounced
"zuul," as if that spelling helped any, and short for "XML-based User
Interface Language") is our name for the scripting language in which
these UI descriptions are built.</P>

<P>Window chrome is displayed and managed by the same layout engine
that manages HTML content in the browser. UI descriptions, then, look
a great deal like HTML 4. XUL is an application of XML. In fact, it
<I>is</I> just XML with specific meaning defined for a few element
types, and into which HTML can be scattered.</P>

<P>Readers of the First Draft of this document will notice that a
fundamental change has taken place in the way a UI is described. The
first draft documented an intention to add springs and struts to the
layout model, and spent a great deal of time worrying about keeping
the content in separate files from specific (perhaps different on
different platforms) layout instructions: the separation of content
and form. The springs and struts layout model has been abandoned in
favor of an HTML 4/CSS model, and the separation of content and form,
beyond the not inconsiderable capabilities provided by those
standards, has been recognized as overly ambitious.</P>

<H2>Terms</H2>

<P>"XPFE" is the term Mozilla-the-organization is using to describe
Mozilla-the-browser's Cross Platform Front End, because X and C look
similar if you beat them long and hard with a hammer. The intention
is to build cross-platform applications like browsers and mail
clients from a set of tools designed for that purpose. The intention
is <I>not</I> to implement a generic cross-platform application
framework. That's been done, and is a great deal of work. We intend
to provide a subset of cross-platform functionality suitable for
building network applications like browsers, leveraging the
cross-platform functionality already built into Gecko, Mozilla's HTML
layout engine.</P>

<P>The term "cross-platform UI" is somewhat misleading. UI designers
will be able to create UI descriptions which will work on multiple
platforms. But proper UI descriptions which take into account various
platforms' differing ideas about proper placement of such things as
dialog buttons will require some platform-specific work. A single XUL
specification can only cross-platform to a degree. UI designers and
build engineers will need to maintain separate, platform-specific
versions of at least some XUL documents.</P>

<P>"XPToolkit" is rather synonymous with XPFE. Though the former term
seems more concrete than the other, and therefore is not an exact
replacement, no one is completely certain why we have both.</P>

<P>"XUL" already introduced, is an application of XML used to
describe the layout of most windows in the Mozilla browser, including
and especially the main, browser window.</P>

<H2>Scope</H2>

<P>This paper makes no attempt to explain requirements. We don't have
a current "requirements" document. <A HREF="aom/AOM.html">XPToolkit
Architecture</A> is a better place to gain an understanding of such
things. This paper contains a short introduction to Mozilla front-end
architecture, concentrating on the task of building UIs. It is, as
always, incomplete.</P>

<P>Mozilla applications will be built of "small" components like
dialog buttons and mail inbox folders, which we collectively term
"widgets." Within a widget, drawing and user interactions are
completely under control of the individual widget, and set when the
widget was built. Relative placement of widgets, their interactions
with each other, and optionally some of their configuration, will be
controlled by a UI layout specified in a script whose structure is
defined in this and related documents.</P>

<P>Widgets are pieces of the application largely self-contained,
generally corresponding to a rectangle of window real estate. Widgets
will generally live grouped in separate, dynamically loaded
libraries. A widget may expect to own a piece of a window (a toolbar
or toolbar set), or it may be expected to work within or without a
window (menubars, depending on the platform). It may not be a part of
the application UI at all.</P>

<P>Widgets will have predefined behaviour, set at compilation.
Buttons will respond to the mouse; toolbars will act as containers
for buttons. The effect a widget will have on its application will be
defined as a combination of predefined application behaviour and,
generally, JavaScript built into the XUL. Applications, for instance,
will have preconceived notions of what to do when they receive an
"open file" command. An "open" button will send its command to the
application using some simple JavaScript for linkage.</P>

<P>We are at first primarily concerned with the obvious UI
components: toolbars, menus and dialogs. Conceptually, the XUL
language will allow someone with a text editor, given a package of
components which can work together, the ability to put together an
application by specifying something like this (for an application on
an OS using menubars across the top of its applications'
windows):</P>

<PRE>main window containing
  menubar area at top across width of window containing
    menubar (and its contents)
  toolbar area below menubar across width of window containing
    main toolbar (and its contents)
  application-specific content area below toolbar area</PRE>

<H2>Structure of a XUL File</H2>

<P>Our language of choice is <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/XML/">XML</A>,
flavoured with <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2">CSS</A>
stylistic information. Having said that, the details of a particular
application of XML; say, the syntax for specifying a toolbar, are
left to separate documents describing those particular applications.
Every widget built into Mozilla will need to have such a document.
Check the XPFE index for the most recent list.
<A NAME=widgetlist></A>At time of writing, authors of these widgets
have been kind enough to document their designs:</P>

<UL>
   <LI><A HREF="MenusSpec.html#Syntax">menus</A></LI>
   
   <LI><A HREF="ToolbarSpec.html#Syntax">toolbars</A></LI>
   
   <LI><A HREF="TreeSpec.html#Syntax">trees</A></LI>
   
   <LI><A HREF="menubutton/MenuButtonSpec.html#Syntax">image and menu
   buttons</A></LI>
   
   <LI><A HREF="progressbar/progressMeterSpec.html#Syntax">progress
   meter</A></LI>
</UL>

<P>Since XUL is a language for describing window layout, there is
some overlap in the topics covered by this document and separate
documents describing XUL windows.</P>

<UL>
   <LI><A HREF="dialogs.html">windows</A></LI>
   
   <LI><A HREF="dialogcookery.html">dialog cookbook</A></LI>
</UL>

<P>As pointed out in the above documents, the task of writing a XUL
window description is basically the same as the task of writing an
HTML content description, with these exceptions: the syntax is XML
(not that different from HTML 4), and there are some elements unique
to XUL. These elements are widgets and certain infrastructure
associated with the behaviour of the window, explained below.</P>

<P>Most of the details of writing a XUL document are identical to those for writing 
  an XML document, a description of which we will leave to other excellent XML 
  documentation which we assume must exist but have never seen. This document 
  will concentrate on XUL-specific features.</P>
<h3>A Word on Case and Namespaces, and Filetypes</h3>
<p>XML is of course case sensitive. XUL is equally so. Our current code tends 
  not to be strict about enforcing this, especially for tags and attributes in 
  the HTML namespace. This will change: tags and attributes will, as a rule, always 
  be lower case as suggested in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-html-in-xml/">XHTML 
  Working Draft</a>.</p>
<p>Mozilla gives a special meaning to XUL files; it expects to find UI descriptions 
  within. For this reason, we've defined a MIME type "text/xul" mapped to files 
  with the extension ".xul". (For standards purposes, we will probably need to 
  change the the mime type to something like "text/x-xul".) These files are processed 
  using the same parser as "text/xml" files (and therefore subject to XML syntax 
  rules, as they should be). It's possible to load a XUL document from an XML 
  file (one named *.xml). The resulting UI will be created using an XML content 
  model. A XUL content model is generated from *.xul files. XML documents support 
  the basic DOM Level 1 Core APIs. XUL documents support an extended set, much 
  as HTML documents support DOM Level 1 HTML APIs. Mozilla's XUL content models 
  also support nifty features like local/remote merging; see the <a href="xulrdf.htm">XUL 
  and RDF document</a> for details. In general, you will want to store XUL in 
  *.xul files. </p>
<p>A XUL file can contain XML elements and HTML elements, as well as special elements 
  unique to XUL: XUL elements. <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml-names/">Namespace</a> 
  declarations for each must be included in the file, though in practice, the 
  XML namespace is covered by XUL. Namespaces must be treated carefully. In particular, 
  be certain to use the same namespace for all of an element's attributes as for 
  the element itself. A widget specified</p>
<pre><code>&lt;html:button xul:onclick=&quot;DoSomething()&quot;&gt;</code></pre>
<p>will almost certainly not work as expected; the onClick handler will probably 
  be lost. If namespaces are always used explicitly as in the example above, this 
  would be a difficult mistake to make. But beware implicit namespaces. In a section 
  of XML operating under an implicit XUL namespace, the widget</p>
<pre><code>&lt;html:button onclick=&quot;DoSomething()&quot;&gt;</code></pre>
<p>has exactly the same problem.</p>
<h3></h3>
<h3>XUL File Preamble</h3>
<P>XUL is XML, and a good XUL file begins with the standard XML version and DOCTYPE 
  statements.</P>
<P>Since XML has no implicit display semantics, there must always be associated 
  stylesheets. Mozilla includes a standard stylesheet, "xul.css". It is currently 
  built into the distribution at <code>resource:/res/samples/xul.css</code>. Generally, 
  you will want to include this style sheet in your files with a stylesheet processing 
  instruction.</P>
<P>And finally, any namespaces used in the document must be declared. Generally, 
  a XUL file will begin</P>
<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
&lt;?xml-stylesheet href="xul.css" type="text/css"?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE window&gt;
&lt;window xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40"
  xmlns="http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul&quot;&gt;</code></pre>
<P>The HTML namespace is of course the standard one. The XUL namespace is obviously 
  a temporary one, but at least serves to explain the pronunciation. For the moment, 
  that exact namespace must be declared in any XUL file. Note that the above example 
  is using an implicit XUL namespace. This is optional; other examples in this 
  document will on occasion belabor the namespace issue by declaring each use 
  explicitly. </P>

<H3>Scripting</H3>

<P>XUL can contain HTML content, including JavaScript. JavaScript
functions may be added in a fashion similar to HTML. There is no
<CODE>&lt;head&gt;</CODE> section of a XUL file, so script is just
mixed in with the other content, delimited by a
<CODE>&lt;script&gt;</CODE> tag in the HTML namespace.</P>

<PRE><CODE>&lt;html:script&gt;
  // dialog initialization code<BR>  function InitWindow() {<BR>    var checkbox = ElementByID("remember");<BR>    if (checkbox)<BR>      checkbox.checked = true;<BR>  }
&lt;/html:script&gt;</CODE></PRE>

<H3>XUL Elements</H3>

<P>As mentioned above, a XUL file is mostly an HTML file with XML
syntax. A XUL file may contain nothing but HTML elements and be
completely functional. But XUL defines several element types unique
to itself, which add functionality to the window.</P>

<H4>Widgets</H4>

<P>Widgets are generally objects like form controls: buttons, text
boxes, tree controls and the like. A window can just as easily
contain HTML form elements (using the <CODE>html</CODE> namespace)
like any HTML content (though there is no need to put them within a
<CODE>&lt;form&gt;</CODE> tag).</P>

<P>XUL defines several new widget types, enumerated at <A HREF="neededWidgets.html">Required
Widgets</A>. Not all of these widgets have been implemented at time
of writing. Each widget will define a unique XML syntax for
describing itself; see the <A HREF="#widgetlist">widget
documentation</A> for details.</P>

<H4>Other Infrastructure</H4>

<P>Widgets may have JavaScript event handlers just as in HTML, and
are tied together using JavaScript and broadcaster nodes. Broadcaster
nodes are declared as <CODE>&lt;broadcaster&gt;</CODE> elements in
the XUL description, and are involved with the communication of
changes of state between widgets. A widget or several widgets can
arrange to have the value of one of their attributes be tied to a
broadcaster node. This tie is defined within the XUL:</P>

<PRE><CODE>&lt;xul:window xmlns:xul ="http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul"&gt; 
  &lt;xul:broadcaster xul:id="canGoBack"/&gt;
  &lt;xul:titledbutton xul:src="resource:/res/toolbar/TB_Back.gif"
    xul:align="bottom" xul:value="Back" xul:onclick="BrowserBack()"&gt;
    &lt;xul:observes xul:element="canGoBack" xul:attribute="disabled"/&gt;
  &lt;/xul:titledbutton&gt;
&lt;/xul:window&gt;</CODE></PRE>

<P>But it is up to the application code to locate the broadcasters
within a window so it can punch them when necessary.</P>

<P>Broadcasters can broadcast any change of state, which can be tied
to the value of any attribute in another XUL widget. For more
complete documentation, see <A HREF="broadcasters.html">Broadcasters
and Observers</A>.</P>

<H3>Future Direction</H3>

<P>Ideally, packages of XUL UI descriptions could be shipped in a
single file something like</P>

<PRE><CODE>&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
&lt;?xml-stylesheet href="xul.css" type="text/css"?&gt; 
&lt;!DOCTYPE package&gt;
&lt;package xmlns="http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul"&gt; 
  &lt;window id="main"&gt;
    ...
  &lt;/window&gt;
  &lt;window id="help"&gt;
    ...
  &lt;/window&gt;
&lt;/package&gt;</CODE></PRE>

<P>And a window (or other service) could be instantiated by first
parsing the whole package and then picking out a window from its
contents</P>

<PRE><CODE>Package *package = LoadPackage("http://xxx/package.xul");
InstantiateWindow(package, GetNodeWithID("main");
</CODE></PRE>

<P>This happy scheme doesn't work today, because the code expects the
result of parsing an XML document to be a window. So currently, a
single XUL file must contain a single window.</P>

<PRE><CODE>&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
&lt;?xml-stylesheet href="xul.css" type="text/css"?&gt; 
&lt;!DOCTYPE window&gt;
&lt;window xmlns="http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul"&gt; 
  ...
&lt;/window&gt;</CODE></PRE>

<P>And the corresponding code is a little more slanted toward getting
a window</P>

<PRE><CODE>InstantiateWindow("http://xxx/window.xul");</CODE></PRE>

<P>We would like to head more toward the "package" implementation in
the future.</P>

<H2>Internationalization</H2>

<P>For practical reasons, the locale-specific attributes of a UI
description would be most happily developed (and possibly
distributed) in separate files, where localization can be performed
by altering only a subset of the UI description devoted expressly to
localization issues. That is, a separate file of localized
strings.</P>

<P>Mozilla has settled on <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-xml-19980210#sec-references">XML
entities</A> as the mechanism of internationalization. Entities are a
feature of the language and therefore outside the scope of this
paper. A XUL file can be made localizeable very easily by
substituting entities for any content which may change as the locale
changes. The localized text must be defined in a separate <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-xml-19980210#sec-prolog-dtd">DTD</A>
or DTD fragment. The exact mechanism for choosing the correct DTD at
runtime has yet to be defined for certain, but we think will involve
hooking into the parser to catch an XML processing instruction, and
adding a locale identifier to the associated URL.</P>
