NSPR 2.0: Thread priorities</H2>
<FONT SIZE=-1>[ Fri Apr 25 12:40:57 PDT 1997]</FONT>

<P>The notion of a <I>priority</I> associated with a thread of execution
is fairly well established. The implication is that a thread with the most
urgent priority level that is schedulable will be running. In operating
systems that provide threading and those threads are scheduled based purely
on their priority, that is a fairly basic and implementable model.

<P>However, there are effectively no such systems in existence today. The
reason is that the model is very <I>unsafe</I>. Any thread that elevates
its priority above other threads in the system and then, intentionally
or not, misbehaves, can starve all the other threads. If the threads are
globally scheduled, that could effectively deadlock an entire system. Therefore
most vendors have chosen a more <I>safe</I> (and complicated) model for
scheduling. NSPR, being subject to all such models (and there are several)
has tried to get a working common solution.

<P>There are inconsistent mechanisms to control the priority of globally
scheduled execution entities. Where they are available to a non privileged
user, NSPR will attempt to make use of them. In cases where there seems
to be no reliable mechanism available, NSPR will silently suppress client
attempts to control priorities in the belief that the host OS will be doing
<I>the right thing</I>.

<P>NSPR implements a virtual processor called a <B><TT>CPU</TT></B>. A
<B><TT>CPU </TT></B>is <I>globally</I> scheduled, <I>i.e.</I>, it is scheduled
by the host operating system. In UNIX or NT, this would be equivalent to
a <I>process</I>. In other systems such as Macintosh or WIN16, full process
semantics are not available, but a similar concept (perhaps called an <I>application</I>)
is available. Some systems provide multiple global scheduable entities
per process (<I>threads</I>). There are several such systems available
in the community today and more showing up all the time (e.g., Solaris
threads, WIN32 threads, IRIX' sprocs and pthreads on several UNIXs).
NSPR exploits such systems by allowing the creation of multiple <B><TT>CPU</TT></B>s
per process.

<P>Associated with each <B><TT>CPU </TT></B>are one or more <I>locally</I>
scheduled NSPR threads. Local threads are another level of virtual processor,
each possessing their own <I>stack</I> and <I>processor state</I>. NSPR
directly manages (schedules) local threads; the host operating system is
not aware that they exist. Therefore, one can say that NSPR will schedule
the highest priority thread associated with a particular CPU.

<P>The thread priority is only a relationship between the threads being
supported by a single <B><TT>CPU</TT></B>, and assumes that the <B><TT>CPU</TT></B>s
are scheduled <I>fairly </I>by the OS. The implementation may be considered
to be an array where there are as many elements in the array as there are
unique priority levels. The contents of the array's elements are a circular
list of <I>ready</I> threads. To select a thread for scheduling, take the
thread off the <I>head </I>of the circular list from the highest priority
element of the array. When <I>descheduling</I> a thread, put it at the
<I>tail</I> of the list of the priority at which that thread is running.

<P>The caveat is that one cannot predict what <B><TT>CPU </TT></B>is supporting
a thread at any given time.

<P>Thread priorities a specified by the client. NSPR provides the opportunity
to assign a priority when the thread is created and later through another
API item (<B><TT>SetThreadPriority()</TT></B>). This latter function is
troublesome. It allows one thread to modify the priority of another. This
is not a <I>safe</I> operation, and it is expensive to implement in the
likely expected manner. Consequently, the semantics of<B><TT> SetThreadPriority()</TT></B>
are that it will take effect the <I>first time a thread is descheduled</I>.
This is very close to the expected behavior if the thread affected is the
current thread (self). However, it may not behave exactly as expected if
the affected thread is other than self since the affected thread must actually
get scheduled before the affect can be recorded.

<P>The reasons for this strategy are due to runtime considerations. Any
operation where one thread affects the state of another is expensive in
the runtime. Most of the expense of the operations goes away if the thread
is only allowed to modify its own state. Specifically in the NSPR runtime,
the issues are as follows: The priority field of a thread structure is
a full, aligned word. We can write that word safely without any locking.
What the runtime needs to protect is when the field is to be applied. The
only time that the priority has any effect is when a thread is <I>descheduled
</I>- it indicates what slot to store it in. If we don't attempt to apply
the change in priority until such time the affected thread is descheduled,
then we really need no locking.
