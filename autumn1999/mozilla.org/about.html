<center> <h1> who we are</h1></center>

<P>
The Mozilla community includes all those who contribute to Mozilla:
writing code, testing software, writing documentation, developing web pages
and applications, advocating on behalf of Mozilla, or doing any of the
multitude of other things that help make Mozilla useful and successful.
Some participate as individual volunteers, some through their educational
institution, and others work at commercial companies.
<p>These actions ultimately determine the direction of the Mozilla project,
through the contributions made and through participation in the Mozilla
discussion groups and mailing lists where the day-to-day activity takes
place.
<P>
<center>
<b>mozilla.org</b>
<hr WIDTH="20%"></center>

<p>As an organization, mozilla.org has responsibility for making Mozilla
a successful open-source project and a successful open-source product;
it exists to serve and support the entire Mozilla community.
<p>The staff of mozilla.org is composed of members of that community who
have a more formalized involvement with mozilla.org. We work for
different companies and represent different interests, but we share the
common task of making the organization and project infrastructure work
well so that everyone (ourselves included) can focus on making the code
work better. Most (but not all) of us are paid by our respective employers
to work on mozilla.org activities.
<dl>
<dt>
<dt>
<b>Mitchell Baker (<a href="mailto:mitchell@mozilla.org">mitchell@mozilla.org</a>)</b></dt>
<dd>
Mitchell is the manager, problem arbitrator, and speaker to suits, which
involves doing mysterious political things of which technical people are
blissfully unaware. She also translates between suit-speak
and the language the rest of us understand. If it's a question that's
not about code, she's probably got her fingers in it.</dd>
<P>
As one of the first people in Netscape's legal department, Mitchell helped
the company get big and became a manager. More recently, she helped unleash
Mozilla's source code on the world with her work on the Netscape and Mozilla
Public Licenses.</dd>

<P>
<dt>
<b><a href="http://people.redhat.com/blizzard/">Chris Blizzard</a> (<a href="mailto:blizzard@mozilla.org">blizzard@mozilla.org</a>)</b></dt>
<dd>
Chris hacks on various parts of Mozilla. The straight Xlib port of
Mozilla is mostly his fault. He also hacks on the gtk port when it
really needs help and people ask really nicely. He dreams of things
like adding Web DAV support and other fun network features. He also
dreams about the directions the mozilla project could take and what we
can accomplish.</dd>
<P>
Chris has been using Linux and open software since the 0.99 days.
Starting as a user he self taught himself programming and now hacks on
various projects when he has time. He's been working with Mozilla
code since the source was released. In the past he's played roles
as a sysadmin, web jockey, database programmer and project manager.</dd>

<P>
<dt>
<b><a href="http://people.netscape.com/brendan/">Brendan Eich</a> (<a href="mailto:brendan@mozilla.org">brendan@mozilla.org</a>)</b></dt>
<dd>
Brendan is responsible for architecture and technical direction of Mozilla.
He is charged with authorizing module owners, owning architectural
issues of the source base and writing the "mozilla roadmap" that
outlines the direction of the mozilla project.</dd>
<P>
Brendan created <a href="js/">JavaScript</a>, did the work through Navigator
4.0, and helped carry it through international standardization. Before
Netscape, he wrote operating system and network code for SGI; and at MicroUnity,
wrote micro-kernel and DSP code, and did the first MIPS R4K port of gcc,
the GNU C compiler.</dd>

<P>
<dt>
<b><a href="http://people.netscape.com/endico/">Dawn Endico</a> (<a href="mailto:endico@mozilla.org">endico@mozilla.org</a>)</b></dt>
<dd>
Dawn is a toolsmith and webmaster. In addition to getting
<A HREF="http://lxr.mozilla.org/">LXR</A> working on
the mozilla source code, Dawn works to keep the documentation
on this site organized and up to date.
<P>
In previous lives Dawn has, worked as a Production Artist, exhibited 
digital artwork, designed commercial web sites, and worked
as a system administrator.</dd>

<P>
<dt>
<b><a href="http://www.hecker.org/">Frank Hecker</a> (<a href="mailto:hecker@mozilla.org">hecker@mozilla.org</a>)</b></dt>
<dd>
<P>
Frank Hecker is mozilla.org's token sales droid and resident grammarian; 
Frank was one of the people who successfully sold Netscape management on 
the advantages of releasing source code, and he tries to  promote the 
cause of Mozilla and open source in his business activities and through 
his writings. 
<P>
For most of his career Frank has been a sales 
<a href="http://www.hecker.org/writings/se.html">systems
engineer</a>, a position tailor-made for those unable to handle a full-time
job either writing software or selling it. He has a special interest in
crypto and security software, and among other things is the keeper of the
Mozilla Crypto FAQ.</dd>

<P>
<dt>
<b><a href="http://www.kotalampi.com/">Risto Kotalampi</a> (<a href="mailto:risto@mozilla.org">risto@mozilla.org</a>)</b></dt>
<dd>
Risto is a Senior Systems Administrator and member of Netscape's server support
team, and leads the systems support for mozilla.org's servers. He's originally from
Finland ... the country where the Open Source movement, Internet and
telecommunications are going strong. 
<P>
He is one of those whose path to Netscape came through AOL/Netscape merger and
before joining the Netscape server support team he was supporting ImagiNation
Network, WorldPlay Entertainment and AOL Games Engineering in Burlingame, and 
AOL Interactive Services in San Mateo. 
</dd>

<P>
<dt>
<b><a href="http://people.netscape.com/dmose/">Dan Mosedale</a> (<a href="mailto:dmose@mozilla.org">dmose@mozilla.org</a>)</b></dt>
<dd>
Dan is a mozilla.org toolsmith. His current project is to build tools to
make the management and shepherding of the Mozilla newsgroups and mailing
lists easier. Probable upcoming projects include adding LDAP support to
the various mozilla.org tools as well as merging LXR and Bonsai functionality.</dd>
<P>
Before joining mozilla.org full-time, Dan was the sysadmin at Mosaic Communications
Corp. From there, he moved on to IS Architecture work at Netscape, co-wrote
the DNS server used by Netcenter to distribute its website worldwide, and
enhanced and maintained Netscape's mail-to-news gateway code.</dd>

<P>
<dt>
<b>Daniel (Leaf) Nunes (<a href="mailto:leaf@mozilla.org">leaf@mozilla.org</a>)</b></dt>
<dd>
Leaf is mozilla.org's release engineer and build-issue spear catcher.
He spends a lot of time worrying about piddly little details, like whether
or not the Mozilla source can be compiled into something runnable.
This means he worries about details like the build system(s) and getting
the source (and test executables) to developers.</dd>
<P>
Leaf is a veteran of UC Santa Cruz and <a href="http://www.fabrik.com">Fabrik
</a>,
and his sense of humour and compassion is greatly appreciated by everyone
who recieves a 3AM "so you broke the tree" wake-up call.</dd>

<P>
<dt>
<b><a href="http://people.netscape.com/shaver/">Mike Shaver</a> (<a href="mailto:shaver@netscape.com">shaver@mozilla.org</a>)</b></dt>
<dd>
shaver is the token Canadian. By day he hangs out with the mozilla
development community, listening to what people are using mozilla code
for, what they’re working on, what works and what doesnt. By night,
he hacks the code and occasionally fixes things. Mostly, he focuses
on giving out guidance and T-shirts, in approximately equal quantities.</dd>
<P>
Mike is a veteran of the free software (especially Linux) scene, and is
a loud and persistent champion of free software within Netscape. Before
Netscape, Mike played CTO for a little Canadian consulting company called
<a href="http://www.ingenia.ca">Ingenia</a>
(now a part of <a href="http://www.sofkin.ca">Software Kinetics</a>).</dd>

<P>
<dt>
<b><a href="http://www.weissman.org/">Terry Weissman</a> (<a href="mailto:terry@omzilla.org">terry@mozilla.org</a>)</b></dt>
<dd>
Terry writes and maintains the <a href="bugs/">Bugzilla</a> and <a href="bonsai.html">Bonsai</a>
tools used in the operation of mozilla.org. Terry also keeps the rest of
us from doing dumb things to Bugzilla.</dd>
<P>
Terry wrote the one-third of the initial version of Netscape Mail and News
(in Navigator 2.0 and 3.0) that <a href="http://www.jwz.org">Jamie</a>
didn't do. He also worked on Mail and News in Communicator 4.0, and has
worked on Netscape's internal bug-tracking and CVS tools. He's had previous
experience in free software: he wrote xmh, a free mail reader, and worked
on the original Xt toolkit and Athena widgets.</dd>
