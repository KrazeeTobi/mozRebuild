<b><font color="#330033"><font size=+1>Intern Positions Descriptions</font></font></b>
<blockquote><a NAME="gecko"></a><b>GECKO STANDARDS QA</b>
<br><b><i>Responsibilities</i></b>
<ul>
<li>
Perform functional, stress and ad-hoc testing of CSS, XML and HTML support
via automated and manual test methodologies</li>

Create new test cases for the assigned areas, and maintain existing test
suites</li>

Update test specifications and/or test case matrices for new test cases</li>

<li>
Participate on getting automation to run parser and layout test cases</li>

<ul>

the features that need someone to develop and execute tests: <a href="http://marvin.mcom.com/testcasenav/indextestcasemarvin.html">http://marvin.mcom.com/testcasenav/indextestcasemarvin.html</a></li>

<blockquote><a NAME="browser"></a><b>BROWSER UE/UI QA</b>
<br><b><i>Responsibilities</i></b></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Bug verification and pre-screening of external bugs submitted by mozilla.org
testers</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
We are currently overwhelmed by the sheer numbers of resolved bugs needing
verification and new bugs requiring pre-screening to determine if they
are in fact valid (checking for duplicates, reproducible test cases, different
platforms, reproducibility, etc). An intern could help out greatly here,
reducing this burden and allowing us to spend more time testing in our
areas of responsibility.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Coverage of features currently marked 'won't test'.</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
As the product development for 5.0 continues, we are identifying certain
areas that need more coverage than we initially planned for. These areas
include (not an exhaustive list):</li>

<ul>
<li>
Downloadable/Configurable Chrome is currently slated as 'won't test' due
to lack of resources</li>

<li>
Windows Controls (restore, minimize, maximize, etc) is currently slated
as 'won't test' due to lack of resources</li>

<li>
Also, other areas will undoubtedly arise as outside developers continue
contributing to the mozilla.org project.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Automation</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
We have been tasked to investigate automation opportunities to alleviate
some of our manual testing. Currently, we have no one slated to investigate
this, much less implement this. An intern could contribute greatly here:</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<b><i>Required Skills</i></b>
<ul>
<li>
Javascript and/or C programming skills to understand and then implement
automation for front-end Browser and Composer areas</li>

<li>
Knowledge of WindowsNT/95/98, Macintosh, and Linux operating systems to
ensure platform parity in automation</li>

<li>
Good communication skills</li>

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<blockquote><a NAME="mail"></a><b>MAIL/NEWS QA</b>
<br><b><i>Responsibilities</i></b>
<ul>
<li>
<b>General</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
Execution of basic functional tests during milestone periods</li>

<li>
Verification of resolved bugs</li>

<li>
Execution of functional tests for areas including basic functionality,
attachments, composition, layout of messages.&nbsp; For a full listing,
please contact me.</li>

<li>
Investigation of problems reported by external and internal users</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Coverage of new mail features submitted by mozilla.org contributors,
etc</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
We have a few new features which were not planned when we allocated headcount/resources.&nbsp;
We'd like to have these features covered in our group.</li>

<ul>
<li>
See this link for the features that need someone to write/modify tests
and execute them:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/quality/mailnews/tests/">http://www.mozilla.org/quality/mailnews/tests/</a></li>
</ul>

<li>
We have quite a few "Help Wanted" bugs that may get implemented between
now and when 5.0 will ship.&nbsp; See here for a list of all our HELP WANTED
bugs:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/mailnews/jobs.html">http://www.mozilla.org/mailnews/jobs.html</a></li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Coverage of features that require more in-depth coverage than initially
planned</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
As the product development for 5.0 continues, we are identifying certain
areas that need more coverage than we initially planned for. These areas
include (not an exhaustive list):</li>

<ul>
<li>
Profile Migration - we discovered that the coverage for this by the installation
group only "touches" the mail preferences.&nbsp; We decided that more coverage
was needed to be devoted to mail migration.</li>

<li>
Mail Performance - this is turning out to be time-consuming, especially
if we want to run once a week.&nbsp; We've worked a bit with development
on this and input is to get standard deviations of several runs.&nbsp;
We'd like to be able to enhance our input further by helping out and using
Quantify to give even more valuable data.&nbsp; The person running this
is also performing API testing.</li>

<li>
Mail Memory Leak coverage - this is turning out to be very valuable for
the mail team.&nbsp; We've been running this once a week on basic mail
functionalities and would like to expand this testing to other mail features.&nbsp;
The person running this is also performing API testing.</li>

<li>
User scenarios - we'd like to have coverage of the basic and advanced user
scenarios which our customer-base are likely to run into. This type of
testing is more integration testing.&nbsp; The person working on this area
also is covering Account Setup which is turning out to be a large new feature
of 5.0.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Coverage of lab maintenance</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
We have machines to recycle and clean up in our lab that can be a time-consuming
task.</li>

<li>
We have servers to upgrade.&nbsp; Need someone to investigate and find
the current versions and install them on our machines with minimal downtime.</li>

<li>
We have operating systems to upgrade.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<b><i>Required Skills</i></b>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Organizational</b> - Know where to look for information and resources.&nbsp;
Ability to complete tasks in a timely manner.</li>

<li>
<b>Troubleshooting - </b>Possess methodical troubleshooting techniques
to narrow down problems encountered.</li>

with minimal supervision.</li>

<b>Communication</b> - excellent written and verbal communication skills.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Ability to report bugs clearly and concisely.&nbsp;&nbsp; Analyze bug reports
reported by external users and ask appropriate questions to narrow problems
down.</li>
