<P><B>Who We Are and What We Do</B> <BR>
<BR>
Mozilla Quality Assurance (QA) is a network of countless volunteers from the net
community and several dozen Netscape employees. We share the common mission of <B>taming
the lizard through finding and constructively reporting relevant bugs in mozilla.org
open source projects</B>.<BR>
We typically <B>find bugs</B> by discovering the ways in which the Mozilla client
software's actual behavior deviates from the expected behavior, as determined by
specifications from the W3C, IETF, Netscape, and other such organizations.<BR>
<BR>
We typically <B>report bugs</B> by researching and writing reproducible and specific
bug reports in <FONT COLOR="#0000EE">Bugzilla</FONT>, the Mozilla bug tracking system.<BR>
&#160; <BR>
<B>Why Should I Get Involved?</B> <BR>
<BR>
To quote Eric S. Raymond, &quot;<FONT COLOR="#0000EE">Given enough eyeballs, all
bugs are shallow.</FONT>&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Opportunities to contribute abound for those who may not write software, but who
wish to exercise the daily Mozilla builds and constructively report the bugs that
they discover. Bugs reported by the rest of the world receive equal attention to
the bugs submitted by Netscape employees.<BR>
<BR>
By joining Mozilla QA, you can contribute to placing a fast, stable, and truly standards-compliant
browser and mail/news reader onto the hard disks of tens of millions of Internet
users, even without writing a single line of code. <BR>
<B>How Can I Contribute?<BR>
<BR>
</B>Right now, you can contribute by rigorously exercising the daily builds, and
reporting reproducible bugs in <FONT COLOR="#0000EE">Bugzilla</FONT>. Mozilla QA
is gearing up to publish Netscape's internal browser test case suites onto mozilla.org,
and to host a library of Netscape and Net Community test case suites. <BR>
