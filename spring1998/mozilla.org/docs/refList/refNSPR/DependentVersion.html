Dependent version checking</H2>

<P>This memo is a proposal for a mechanism that allows cooperating components
to divulge their own versioning information and compare that to their import
requirements. In order for this to be effective, all cooperating component
libraries have to include certain capabilities (defined below).

<P>This mechanism's goal is to provide definitive proof that the product
environment (made up of one or more shared libraries) is consistent within
itself. It does not provide static checking that might cause ungraceful
termination of an application. Nor does it provide early detection of inconsistencies
such that might be used to drive selective loading of shared libraries.
<H3>
Version information</H3>
Software components can be identified generically by name (regrettably
I don't know anything better than ASCII). For simplicity the version of
the software component may also be identified by an ASCII string. The string's
content is not significant since (as will be described later) only the
component presenting the version string need understand its makeup.
<H3>
Discovering a component's identity and version</H3>
A component will advertise it identity and version through use of static
defines in a well-know header. Using NSPR as an example, these constants
might show up in a header named <B>prvrsion.h</B> and look like:
<UL><TT>#define PR_NAME     "NSPR 2.0"</TT>
<BR><TT>#define PR_VERSION  "199770530"</TT></UL>
<B>Note: </B>It would be expected that the name of the component ("NSPR
2.0" in this example) would not change for the lifetime of the product.

<P><B>Note: </B>The value of the version string must be such that the component
can parse it and determine compatibility. The example uses a form being
suggested by the Hardcore Build Process (see Annalee's document) as the
way to take various versions of the distribution.

<P>Along with these two constants, each component must provide a function
capable of returning a boolean answer indicating that available library
is compatible with the expectations of the caller. That function has a
signature as follows:
<UL><TT>typedef PRBool (*version_check)(const char *imported_version);</TT></UL>
The importer would literally code this call as (using NSPR as an example):
<UL><PRE>
if (!PR_VersionCheck(PR_VERSION))
{
    ...version check fails...
}</PRE></UL>
At the time a version check routine is called the code should evaluate
the string passed in as the argument with the version the library is exporting.
This string will contain the literal value that was defined by environment
in which the importing component was built. The called function will compare
the string to the value known to it, which represents the value caputured
at its build time. During the execution of the version check function is
the opportunity for the called component to verify its dependencies as
well. The answer returned will be the logical union of all the responses.

<P><B>Caution:</B> Circular dependencies could be a problem.
