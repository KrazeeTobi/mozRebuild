<P>
Using the previously mentioned <a href="checkout.cmd">checkout.cmd</a>, you
can get the latest version of the Warpzilla sources. If you have setup your
environment correctly (using <a href="warpzilla.cmd">warpzilla.cmd</a>),
just call <b>checkout.cmd</b> from X:\Warpzilla. If you have a working connection
to the internet, cvs will begin to download the source code. Depending on the
speed of your internet connection, it may take from one to more than five hours
to completely download all the required (and partly non required) sources.
<p>
Once you have downloaded the current source level, you can always call the
<b>checkout.cmd</b> again and it will only download the files that have been
updated since you've checked out the last time.
<p>
Note that you cannot upload your modifications directely to the server. Only
authorized people can do this! Please refer to the appropriate section for more
information on how to submit your own work to the project.
