<a NAME="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
The document is intended to be read by those with a familarity with with
on or more of the first-tier toolkits and XPCOM.
<h2>
<a NAME="Background"></a>Background</h2>
The MS-Windows toolkit was the first widget toolkit developed for Raptor.
It was developed just as XPCOM was making its way into Raptor. The original
toolkit supported multiple inheriteance of interfaces and XPCOM aggregation
(individual widgets were being aggregated with Raptor "views").
<p>Just after the X11/Motif toolkit was developed on both IRIX and Linux
and the Viewer was up and running, the aggregation of views with widgets
was removed from the architecture. This left a lot of baggage in the Windows
and Motif implementations. As we started the Mac port of the toolkit we
decided to greatly simplify the widget hierarchy and architecture in order
to make it easier to maintain the existing toolkits and port to new toolkit
down the road. Aggregation was removed and we decided all "widget" interfaces
would inherit directly from nsISupports.
<p>These issues will be addressed in more depth later.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
<a NAME="Overview"></a>Overview</h2>
In the past there were three (or more) separate "front-end" code bases
developed for the browser, composer, etc. The main toolkits being MS-Windows,
X-Windows and Macintosh. A separate graphical user interface or GUI was
created with platform specific code. A simple view of the architecture
was as follows:
<center>
<p><img SRC="oldhier.gif" height=177 width=533></center>

<p>As new features were added to the product, this often meant the work
had to be done separately for each platform. An advantage to this approach
was that platform specific Look &amp; Feel was guarenteed for for the set
of common control that existed across platform. It may or may not have
been guarenteed for customed widgets developed for each platform.
<p>NGLayout is fully based on XPCOM and all implementation exists behind
a set of public interfaces. In NGLayout all platform specific code is contained
in the Widget and GFX libraries. The GFX library is responsible for graphics
and rendering primitives. The Widget library encompasses all windowing
and GUI components necessary for creating HTML forms and the GUI interface
on given platform. This approach has many advantages:
<ul>
<li>
The implementation for any given GUI implementation is hidden from the
developer of XP applications.</li>

<li>
The platform specific code is small, easy to maintain and very isolated.</li>

<li>
The widget toolkit maintanance is reduced and it requires fewer platform
secific developers to add new features and maintain it.</li>

<li>
New custom widgets can be written in an "XP" fashion using GFX. This means
they will automatically run on all platforms.</li>
</ul>
The challenge of the XP widget toolkits are:
<ul>
<li>
Platform specific Look &amp; Feel is a bigger challenge for all XP widgets.</li>

<li>
Not all native GUI toolkits contains the same functionality.</li>
</ul>

<p><br>The NGLayout widget toolkit is as follows:
<center>
<p><img SRC="newhier.gif" height=280 width=525></center>

<p>The current "test" Viewer application contains platform specific code
for application start up and for implementing menus. It continues to be
this way today, more for historical reasons than anything else. Recently,
the cross-platform Viewer, with Navigator 4.x chrome, was created almost
entirely from the widget toolkit interfaces (XPFE). The only exception
is application start up and this will soon be cross-platform also.
<p>All NGLayout-based applications will be created completely from the
cross-platform set of APIs.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
<a NAME="Toolkit Requirements"></a>Toolkit Requirements</h2>
In general, the toolkit should be small, fast, and not rely on third party
toolkits like MFC.
<p>The third party toolkits typically:
<ul>
<li>
Unneccesarily add to the size of the toolkit</li>

<li>
Cannot be distributed under our free source agreement</li>

<li>
Their scope can be too large. Sometimes it is necessary to include most
all the of the class hierarchy to use just a few of the classes.</li>

<li>
They do too much. One of the advantages of third party toolkits is that
they make creating GUIs easier by hiding and abstracting the event processing.
This can cause problems when integrating it into the low-level event processing
of NGLayout.</li>

<li>
They add a dependency into our development effort and we become "locked"
into their technology.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a NAME="Interfaces and Inheritance"></a>Interfaces and Inheritance</h2>
In the widget toolkit the nsIWidget interface is responsible for all basic
widget functionality. For example, SetBounds, GetBounds, SetEnabled, IsEnabled
etc. The nsIXXXWidget interface would specify widget specific behavior.
For example, the nsIRadioButton would have an unique "IsChecked" method.
<p>On the surface mulitple inheritance of interfaces seems like a very
useful approach. On MS-Windows all widgets are windows. If we take a look
at a specific example, several issues will emerge. For instance, a nsIRadioButton
inherits from nsIWidget. The interface hierarchy could be: nsIWidget->nsIRadioButton.
The implementation hierarchy would then be nsWindow->nsRadiobutton.
<center>
<p><img SRC="widgetinherit.gif" height=220 width=550></center>

<p><b>Here are the issues:</b>
<ul>
<li>
Virtual base classes cannot be used because they are not supported by all
C++ compilers.</li>

<li>
Since we are not using virtual base classes, each of the nsIWidget's methods
must be qualified for the nsRadioButton. Otherwise the compiler asks: "Does
the method come from nsIWidget that nsIRadioButton derives from? Or does
the method come from the nsIWidget that the nsWindow derives from?"</li>

<li>
All of the widgets that derive from nsIWidget must qualify each method
for the nsIWidget. This can be done using one macro for the header file
specification and an other macro for the implementation, but this gets
very ugly. The nsIWidget interface has quite a number of methods and the
macro would be quite large.</li>

<li>
The Windows toolkit was originally developed with way and it became a maintanence
nightmare.</li>
</ul>

<p><br>A minor point was also made that a developer using the hierarchy
knows that he only needs to look at two interfaces for any given widget:
the nsIWidget interface and the interface for the specific widget. This
is an important point when detailed documentation is not available.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
<a NAME="Event Processing"></a>Event Processing</h2>
The widget toolkit has two personalities. It needs to act as a low-level
toolkit inside of NGLayout's layout engine and a high-level toolkit when
used for XPFE. This dicotomy constrains how the widgets behave and this
affects event processing in several important ways.
<p>The most important, is that when the widgets live inside the layout
engine they are to do as little as possible, they must dispatch all their
events and then wait to be told what to do. JavaScript is a key member
in the event processing chain and JS must be able reject certain events
if it chooses.
<p>For example, when a user clicks on a radiobutton, the radiobutton must
first dispatch the click event and then wait to be told whether it's clicked
or not clicked. The view/frame system or JavaScript determines wether the
radiobutton should process the click event and whether its value should
set or cleared. In many toolkits, radiobutton processing is done automatically,
so in many ways the native toolkit does more than it should.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
<a NAME="Roadmap"></a>Roadmap</h2>
The widget toolkit has been ported to MS-Windows, Motif, and Macintosh.
Others toolkits will follow whether they are developed internall or externally.
<p>Currently, most all the widgets are developed from the native platform
widgets with the exception of the Toolbar, the Toolbar Manager, the ImageButton,
and the MenuButton (a button with an assosicated drop down menu).
<p>Overtime we hope to develop many more cross-platform widgets on top
of GFX that will enable developers to provide their own Look &amp; Feel.
These lightweight will not require a back-end native widget.
