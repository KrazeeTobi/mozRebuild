<H2><A NAME="Goals"></A>Goals</H2>


<P>The goals of the first version of Electrical Fire are to generate a good
Java bytecode just-in-time compiler for all of the platforms supported by
Netscape. We expect the performance of the first implementation to be substantially
better than the Symantec PowerPC JIT.</P>

<P>Win32 will be a special case. It will be necessary for the Win32 implementation
to be competitive with any other Java implementation in the marketplace.</P>

<H2>Assumptions</H2>


<P>To keep the first version of the JIT relatively simple and fast we're
assuming that all of the optimizations that could have been done on the
bytecode level already have been done by the Java source-to-bytecode compiler.
These optimizations include most common subexpression elimination, partial
dependency elimination, code motion out of loops, dead code stripping, constant
propagation, etc. This greatly limits the set of interesting optimizations
and transformations for the JIT and allows us to create a faster JIT. The
interesting optimizations for the JIT are the ones that cannot be expressed
by the Java bytecodes either because they would break the Java security
model, they are target-specific, or Javasoft hasn't thought of them. These
include eliminating redundant null pointer or array range checks, scheduling
instructions to suit the native instruction set, register allocation, and
some strength reduction.</P>

<P>We believe that the Java source-to-bytecode compiler is the right place to 
  do all the optimizations that can be done there because it has much more time 
  to analyze the Java program; the optimizations are done once by the developer 
  (or us) rather than every time the Java code is loaded. We at Netscape can tweak 
  the compiler or use alternative vendors of such a compiler in order to generate 
  good bytecodes for projects like <A HREF="performance.html">Javagator</A>; third-party 
  vendors can do likewise.</P>

<P>In the future we plan to do aggressive interprocedural inlining; this
is the way (other than making some changes to the definition of the Java
language) to get past a coming Java performance plateau. Once we do that,
the assumption that all of the optimizations that could have been done at
the bytecode level have been done will no longer apply because the Java
source-to-bytecode had never seen the inlined combination of methods together.
At that point we'll implement some of the more general and traditional optimizations
in the JIT.</P>

<H2><A NAME="Translation Speed"></A>Translation Speed Goals</H2>


<P>Here are a few simple calculations based on the startup time of a Java-based
Navigator (front end only) or another similary sized component. We are calculating
the necessary translation speed per byte code measured in JIT instructions
executed to translate one bytecode. We examine all four scenarios of having
to translate either two hundred thousand or a million bytecodes on startup
and allowing either two or ten seconds to do it. Ten seconds might seem
unreasonable, but we could maintain a disk cache of the translated bytecodes
between successive runs of the Navigator.</P>

<P></P>

<P>* Assumes a 200 MHz machine executing an average of one instruction per
cycle.</P>

<P>By these back-of-the-envelope calculations we can execute between 400
and 10000 instructions in the JIT for each Java bytecode translated. Our
initial goal is for a number somewhere in the middle of the range, such
as 2000. To reach this goal we have to avoid using algorithms that are substantially
slower than linear on typical code (it may be OK if they are, say, quadratic
on atypical Java code or, if the constant factors are extremely small, even
quadratic on typical code).</P>

<P>These figures do not include the time to run these byte codes. The total
time to translate and execute might be a more interesting number -- as we
spend more time translating, our execution time could go down at a greater
than linear rate.<HR ALIGN=LEFT><P></P>
