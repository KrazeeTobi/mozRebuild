<h2><center>JavaScript XPCOM Components Status</center></h2>
<h3><center>Draft 1</center></h3>


<h3>Introduction</h3>
<blockquote>

In the document <a href="xpjs-components.html">XPJS Components Proposal</a> I
proposed that we build a system for implementing xpcom components and services
in JavaScript - components that could be used transparently by any other xpcom
components.

<p>

<a href="mailto:shaver@mozilla.org">Mike Shaver</a> has since done the 
work to make this system work. This document will explain the status of that
work and will try to detail the limitations of the system as currently implemented.

</blockquote>

<h3>Implementation</h3>
<blockquote>

The system, of course, is all based on <a href="index.html">XPConnect</a>. The 
main innovation was in factoring out the system that xpcom uses to instantiate
components. Previously there was a builtin component loader that assumed that
all components were implemented in C/C++ and either loaded from a DLL or via
factory instances registered (non-persistently) at runtime. Mike broke this code
out to build a plugable component loader system. He then wrote one loader for native
components loaded from DLLs and one for JavaScript components loaded from .js
files. This is an extensible system and we can expect that others will write
additional loaders in the future.

<p>

The JS component loader implementation is in <a
href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/js/src/xpconnect/loader/">/js/src/xpconnect/loader/</a>.
As far as I know Mike Shaver did not write any detailed documentation about its
use. In a nutshell... It will try to load for registration and use as a
component any .js files it discovers in the 'components' directory during
autoregistration time; i.e. the same directory where native components in DLLs
are located. I'm not sure if it will attempt to discover these files everytime
the app is started or only during autoregistration [shaver clarification?].

<p>

The best document that I know of is in the sample at <a
href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/xpcom/sample/nsSample.js">xpcom/sample/nsSample.js</a>.
I think it worth noting that this is both a sample and a bit of a test bed.
There is some unnecessary debug code. And the boilerplate code really ought to
be reorganized a bit with the customizable part broken out as separate variables
so that future JS component implementors can just copy the common blocks and
fill in their own strings for progids and iids etc. Nevertheless, it is the sample we have and the comments in the sample explain how to use the system.

<p> 

An additional source of info on the evolution of the system (for the hardcore
curious) is the discussions on the <a
href="news://news.mozilla.org/netscape.public.mozilla.xpcom">xpcom
newsgroup</a>. Search the  subjects for keywords like: JS components, component
loader.

<p>

Any .js file that shows up in the components directory is a likely example of JS
component usage. Currently, there is a sidebar component. Mike Shaver had
implemented the category manager using JS, but it was reimplemented in C++. Not
because its implementation in JS was not viable, but simply because it was
decided that xpcom should not have a core service which required JavaScript and
XPConnect. This would have limited xpcom's usefulness in some non-browser
embeddings where JavaScript might not otherwise be needed or wanted.

<h3>Bugs</h3>
<blockquote>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=24688">24688</a> - 
runtime errors in wrapped JS are not made obvious

<blockquote> We lack a good place to send JS error reports. The current webshell
error reporting system only works for JS code run on DOM JSContexts (and it
lacks a JSConsole within the app). Right now JS errors in JS components are
caught at the xpconnect layer and are printed to the native console in debug
builds, but are dropped on  the floor in release builds. This hinders the
development and testing of JS components. 

</blockquote>


<li><a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=25180">25180</a> -
xpconnect needs wrappers for JS -> JS communication 

<blockquote> Currently when xpconnect is reflecting an object into JavaScript and
discovers that the object is a wrapped JS object then it will simply unwrap the
object and pass it through. This means that if a component is implemented in JS and then <b>used</b>
by some other JS client code then the client code will be passed the original JS
object. The bad thing here is that this JS object will not <i>look</i> like any
other xpconnect wrapped interface. This turns out to be a serious limitation in
practice.

</blockquote>


<li><a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=27867">27867</a> - 
xpconnect does not always work well with DOM objects

<blockquote>

One of the obvious things that people might want to do with JS components is to
manipulate the DOM and otherwise do user interface activities. A great deal of
interaction between JS components and DOM objects is possible. But some
activities are simply not supported in the current system. If one starts down
this path then it is very possible to reach a point where the thing you want to
do just can't be done. Ultimately we will reimplement the DOM system to itself
use xpconnect and these limitations will go away.


</blockquote>

<li><a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=26725">26725</a>
Access denied to XPConnect service

<blockquote>
This is a security issue that should be fixed real soon now.
</blockquote>

</ul>

</blockquote>

<h3>Conclusions and Recommendations</h3>
<blockquote>

I still think that JavaScript components have a bright future. However, due to
the limitations of the system I can't unconditionally recommend their use at this
time. Some of the limitations really are not likely to be satisfactorily
addressed until after we finish a shipping browser and then go back to really
clean things up. Still, The JS components system is in place and will be in use.
If it looks like the right way to do your component then go for it. Just be aware
of the limitations.
