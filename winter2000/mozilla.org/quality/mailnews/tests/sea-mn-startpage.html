Feature Test Spec</h2>
<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.0 Project (seamonkey)</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mail and News Component</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Start Page</b>
<p>Written by: <b><a href="mailto:pmock@netscape.com">Peter Mock</a></b><b></b>
<p><b>History:</b>
<br>010699&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Incorporated Communicator
4.5 test spec.
<br>033099&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Updated with changes

<br>UI Specification:
<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br>Description: Started in Communicator 4.5, when you launched Messenger
the start page automated loaded in the message pane.&nbsp; This page linked
to Netscape netcenter portal pointing to available services.&nbsp; The
idea was instead of leaving the message pane blank, we could show the user
some useful content by loading a web page into that window.&nbsp; As soon
as the user selected a message in any way, the start page would be replaced
by a normal message.&nbsp; The feature was available only on Win32 platforms
but 5.0, it will be available on all platforms.&nbsp; The public mozilla
and commercial build will point to different start pages.&nbsp; The mozilla
start page is to be determine by the net community. The commercial build
will point to netcenter services.
<br>&nbsp;
