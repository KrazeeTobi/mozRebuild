NSPR Module Description</H2>
NSPR provides platform independence for non-GUI operating system facilities.
These facilities include threads, thread synchronization, normal file and
network I/O, interval timing and calendar time, basic memory management
(malloc and free) and shared library linking. A good portion of the library's
purpose, and perhaps the primary purpose in the Gromit environment, is
to provide the underpinnings of the Java VM, more or less mapping the <I>sys
layer</I> that Sun defines for the porting of the Java VM to various platforms.
NSPR does go beyond that requirement in some areas and since it is also
the platform independent layer for most of the servers produced by Netscape.
<H3>

<HR WIDTH="100%">History</H3>
The current generation of NSPR is known as NSPR20.
The first generation of NSPR was originally conceived
just to satisfy the requirements of porting Java to various host environments.
NSPR20, an effort started in 1996, builds on that original idea,
though very little is left of the original code. (The "20" in
"NSPR20" does not mean "version 2.0" but rather "second generation".)
Many of the concepts have been reformed, expanded, and matured.
Today NSPR may still be appropriate as the platform 
dependent layer under Java, but its primary application is supporting clients 
written entirely in C or C++.
<H3>

<HR WIDTH="100%">How It Works</H3>
NSPR's goal is to provide uniform service over a wide range of operating
system environments. It strives to not export the <I>lowest common denominator</I>,
but to exploit the best features of each operating system on which it runs,
and still provide a uniform service across a wide range of host offerings.
<H4>
Threads</H4>
Threads are the major feature of NSPR. The industry's offering of threads
is quite sundry. NSPR, while far from perfect, does provide a single API
to which clients may program and expect reasonably consistent behavior.
The operating systems provide everything from no concept of threading at
all up to and including sophisticated, scalable and efficient implementations.
NSPR makes as much use of what the systems offer as it can. It is
a goal of NSPR that NSPR impose as little overhead as possible in accessing
those appropriate system features.
<H4>
Thread synchronization</H4>
Thread synchronization is loosely based on Monitors as described by C.A.R.
Hoare in <I>Monitors: An operating system structuring concept</I>, Communications
of the ACM, 17(10), October 1974 and then formalized by Xerox' Mesa programming
language ("Mesa Language Manual", J.G. Mitchell et al, Xerox PARC, CSL-79-3
(Apr 1979)). This mechanism provides the basic mutual exclusion (mutex)
and thread notification facilities (condition variables) implemented
by NSPR. Additionally, NSPR provides synchronization methods more suited
for use by Java. The Java-like facilities include monitor <I>reentrancy</I>,
implicit and tightly bound notification capabilities with the ability to
associate the synchronization objects dynamically.
<H4>
I/O</H4>
NSPR's I/O is a slightly augmented BSD sockets model that allows arbitrary
layering. It is was originally intended to export synchronous I/O
methods only, relying on threads to provide the concurrency needed for
complex applications. That method of operation is preferred though it is
possible to configure the network I/O channels as <I>non-blocking</I> in
the traditional sense.
<H4>
Network addresses</H4>
Part of NSPR deals with manipulation of network addresses. NSPR defines
a network address object that is Internet Protocol (IP) centric. While
the object is not declared as opaque, the API provides methods that allow
and encourage clients to treat the addresses as polymorphic items. The
goal in this area is to provide a migration path between IPv4 and IPv6.
To that end it is possible to perform translations of ASCII strings (DNS
names) into NSPR's network address structures, with no regard to whether
the addressing technology is IPv4 or IPv6.
<H4>
Time</H4>
Timing facilities are available in two forms: interval timing and calendar
functions.

<P>Interval timers are based on a free running, 32-bit, platform dependent
resolution timer. Such timers are normally used to specify timeouts on
I/O, waiting on condition variables and other rudimentary thread scheduling.
Since these timers have finite namespace and are free running, they can
wrap at any time. NSPR does not provide an <I>epoch</I>, but expects clients
to deal with that issue. The <I>granularity</I> of the timers is guaranteed
to be between 10 microseconds and 1 millisecond. This allows a minimal timer 
<I>period </I>in of approximately 12 hours. But in order to deal with the 
wrap-around issue, only half that namespace may be utilized. Therefore, the 
minimal usable interval available from the timers is slightly less than six hours.

<P>Calendar times are 64-bit signed numbers with units of microseconds.
The <I>epoch</I> for calendar times is midnight, January 1, 1970, Greenwich
Mean Time. Negative times extend to times before 1970, and positive numbers
forward. Use of 64 bits allows a representation of times approximately
in the range of -30000 to the year 30000. There is a structural representation
(<I>i.e., exploded</I> view), routines to acquire the current time from
the host system, and convert them to and from the 64-bit and structural
representation. Additionally there are routines to convert to and from
most well-known forms of ASCII into the 64-bit NSPR representation.
<H4>
Memory management</H4>
NSPR provides API to perform the basic malloc, calloc, realloc and free
functions. Depending on the platform, the functions may be implemented
almost entirely in the NSPR runtime or simply shims that call immediately
into the host operating system's offerings.
<H4>
Linking</H4>
<FONT COLOR="#000000">Support for linking (shared library loading and unloading)
is part of NSPR's feature set. In most cases this is simply a smoothing
over of the facilities offered by the various platform providers.
<H3>

<HR WIDTH="100%">Where It's Headed</H3>
NPSR is applicable as a platform on which to write threaded applications
that need to be ported to multiple platforms. The current implementation
supports Macintosh (PPC), WIN-32 (WIN NT, WIN '95) and 20+ versions of
UNIX and is still expanding. The basic API is stable and expected to remain
that way. Additional effort is being put into offering thread safe libraries
and other functionality.
