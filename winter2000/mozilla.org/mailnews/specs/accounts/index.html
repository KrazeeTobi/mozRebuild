Open Issues</h1>

<OL>
   <LI>Tony Robinson: When user's machine is being searched for
   existing 4.x profiles, is it possible to also note if 3rd party
   mail applications are found? That way, we only ask users if they
   want to perform this task if they have existing info to
   import.</LI>
   
   <LI>Should "Import" be an option on the first dialog of the New
   Account Wizard dialogs? Or are creating a new account and
   importing existing accounts two separate tasks and hence two
   separate wizards?</LI>
   
   <LI>Import Tools: Do we show the user a list of types of imports
   we can do, ask them which one, and then find out if they have any
   that match? Or do we first search the machine and find out what
   the user has and then ask them which one(s) they want to
   import?</LI>

Summary</h1>

<P>This spec covers the <B>Account Setup Wizard</B>, <B>Account
Settings Dialogs</B> and the <B>Mail Import Tools</B>.</P>

<P>The <B>Account Setup Wizard</B> is used to set up new mail
accounts (accounts that Netscape Mail did not find either through the
4.x upgrade or inside of 3rd party email applications). It can be run
at anytime the user would like to set up a new mail or news account.
It is run automatically at startup of Netscape Mail <B>IF</B> no 4.x
profile or 3rd party mail applications were found.</P>

<P>The <B>Account Settings Dialogs</B> allow users to manage the
detailed settings of their various Mail, and News accounts.
The Account Settings Dialogs are a separate set of dialogs from the
Preferences dialogs (change from 4.x).</P>

<P>The <B>Mail Import Tools </B>can be used to import settings, email
messages and/or address book entries from 3rd party Mail
Applications. They can be run by using the "File", "Import..." menu
from within Netscape Mail or the Address Book. The user is given the
option to run the Mail Import Tools Wizard at startup of Netscape
Mail <B>IF</B> 3rd party mail applications were found.</P>

Target User</h2>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The <B>Account Setup Wizard</B> should be straight
   forward and easy to use for novice users. It should easily and
   quickly walk them through the necessary steps to setting up a
   Mail, Netscape or News account. Only Required information
   is collected here and basic defaults for account behavior are
   chosen for the user.
   
   <P>The <B>Account Settings Dialogs</B>  (within Preferences) are aimed at more
   intermediate and advanced users who want to customize their
   accounts, change the default settings, add additional SMTP servers
   or associate certain Identities and SMTP servers.</P>
   
   <P>The <B>Mail Import Tools</B> are aimed at more intermediate and
   advanced users who want to import settings, mail messages and/or
   address book entries from 3rd party Mail applications into their
   Netscape Mail.</P>

Notes and Assumptions</h2>

<UL>
   <LI>SMTP and Identity are not bound.</LI>
   
   <LI>Mail from multiple servers/multiple accounts can be retrieved
   (incoming servers) with a single Internet connection (user/system
   does not have to connect to each server separately to retrieve
   mail for each account). A single connection is needed to get the
   user onto the Internet and from there, Messenger is able to
   connect to each individual server.</LI>
   
   <LI>Mail from multiple accounts can be sent out at one time using
   one SMTP server (user/system does not have to connect to each
   server separately to send mail).</LI>
   
   <LI>In order to use ONE specified SMTP server for ALL outgoing
   mail (from different identities), the user must be connected to
   the Internet via the account paired with the specified SMTP
   server.</LI>
   
   <LI>When a user launches Netscape Mail, and has multiple accounts
   set up, the user will see a login (name, password) dialog for each
   account (as necessary).</LI>

<P>The Account Setup Wizard can be launched following the Mail
Startup Wizard if the user requests to set up additional accounts. It
can also be launched on its own at anytime when the user requests to

<P>The Account Setup Wizard should be straight forward and easy to
use for novice users. It should easily and quickly walk users through
the necessary steps for setting up a Mail or News account.
Only Required information is collected here and basic defaults for
account behavior are chosen for the user. Fields are pre-populated
where ever possible.</P>

<P>After each account setup is completed, the user is asked if they
would like to create another account. If so, they are looped back to
the beginning of the Account Wizard.</P>

<A NAME=Tools></A>Mail Import Tools</h2>

<P><b>This section is NOT complete.</b>&nbsp; These are rough ideas only. Comments appreciated.</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#CC0000">Do we show the user a list of types of
imports we can do, ask them which one they want, and then find out if
they have any items to import that match (4.x method)? Or do we first
search the user's machine and find out what the user has and then ask
them which one(s) they want to import?</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Process</H3>

<P>The Mail Import Tool will be as automated as possible. Once the
user selects what 3rd party mail applications they want to import,
all settings, email messages and address book entries will be
imported. Unlike 4.x, users will not be asked to choose which
components they want to import. Once data is being imported, the user
will see a progress indicator which informs the user how far along
the process is and what files are currently being imported.</P>

<P>Local mail which is imported is moved to a folder within the
Netscape Mail "Local Mail" folders area. The name of the folder
defaults to the name of the application from which it was imported. If that name is already taken, then a
number is appended.</P>

<P>If the user imported two POP accounts, each
account would show up in Netscape Mail with it's own hierarchy of
folders, but the mail would be moved to the folders of the first
account and the folders of the second account would be empty. (Since some Mail
applications store all POP local mail together, we won't know
from which account the mail originated).</P>

Determining the Default Account - Draft</h3>

<OL>
   <LI>If the user upgrades from a Netscape 4.x profile and no other
   accounts are created or imported, the Netscape Mail account is the
   default.</LI>
   
   <LI>If the user upgrades from a Netscape 4.x profile and imports
   one or more accounts from 3rd party mail applications, <B>the
   Netscape Mail account is the default? Or do we want to ask the
   user?</B></LI>
   
   <LI>If the user does not upgrade from a Netscape 4.x profile and
   imports one 3rd party mail application, the 3rd party mail
   application account becomes the default.</LI>
   
   <LI>If the user does not upgrade from a Netscape 4.x profile and
   imports more than one 3rd party mail application, we ask the user
   to choose a default (once an additional account has been
   imported).</LI>
   
   <LI>If the user does not upgrade from a Netscape 4.x profile, or
   does not import 3rd party mail applications, and creates one new
   account, the new account becomes the default.</LI>
   
   <LI>If the user does not upgrade from a Netscape 4.x profile, or
   does not import 3rd party mail applications, and creates two or
   more new accounts, we ask the user to choose a default (the user
   is asked to choose at the completion of creating the 2nd new
   account).</LI>
</OL>

<P>So basically, if there is a situation where there is more than one
account (additional accounts are created or imported) and it is
unclear which account should be the default account, we will ask the
user to choose.</P>

<P>It does not make much sense to a user when they are creating a new
account, or importing an account, if the account will be a default.
Users mostly won't understand what default account means and may not
be aware of previously created/imported accounts. For this reason,
users should be asked at the end of account creation/import which
account they would like to set as default. For each new account
created/imported, SMTP server information will be collected. Once the
process (new account setup or import) is complete, users will be
shown a list of all their current accounts, given an explanation of
what it means to have a default account and asked to verify a default
account. The account that was first setup (upgraded, created or
imported) should be preselected. The SMTP information for the default
account is what will be used.</P>

Closed Issues</h2>

<UL>
   <LI>Is it possible for Messenger to determine how the user is
   connected to the Internet (from which account)? If so, users could
   enter an SMTP server for each multiple account and when the user
   wanted to send mail, Messenger could be smart enough to use the
   SMTP server associated with the account that the user is currently
   using to access the Internet. This would prevent the user from
   ever seeing error messages when sending email (if they are
   connected through an account which is not there 'default' SMTP
   server account), make it more understandable for users who expect
   to enter an SMTP server for each account, and allow advanced users
   to enter multiple SMTP servers. <B>No, this is not possible at
   this time.</B></LI>
   
   <LI>Should Account Setup be separated from the Preferences
   dialogs? <B>"Account Settings" will be separate dialogs accessed
   from the "Edit" menu. 6/24/99, Mail Issues meeting.</B></LI>
   
   <LI>Multiple SMTP servers: As a first step, we will allow users to
   enter only one SMTP server (instead of multiple). May provide
   functionality to add multiple SMTP servers (for advanced users) at
   a later time. 5/14/99. <B>This reversed on 6/24/99, Mail Issues
   Meeting. Multiple SMTP servers will be allowed.</B></LI>
   
   <LI>Multiple Identities: <B>One identity per account allowed.
   5/14/99</B></LI>
   
   <LI>Should certain preferences (html vs. plain text, Trash
   behavior, Draft and Templates folders, etc.) be associated with a
   specific account and located within the Account Setup Dialogs (a
   separate item from the preferences), or should they be co-located
   with the other Preferences in the Preferences dialogs?<B>
   Preferences specific to servers (such as Trash and Special
   Folders) will be located in the Account Settings Dialogs. 6/24/99,
   Mail Issues Meeting.</B></LI>
   
   <LI><B>"New Account" button, automatically launches the Account
   Setup Wizard. This may upset advanced users. There there a way
   that this button could be a fly out (like MS's "New" button does)
   and users could pick, "Create using Wizard" or "Create Manually"?
   </B>"New Account" will always launch the Account Wizard.
   6/30/99.</LI>
   
   <LI><B>"Default Account". Is this necessary? What are the benefits
   to being the default account? Does Mail and News each have their
   own Default account? </B>
   Both Mail and News will have a Default Account. When the client
   doesn't have enough information to know what host to send/post a
   message through, the default account is used. 6/30/99.</LI>
   
   <LI><B>Each account must have an "Account Name"? We give it one if
   users doesn't or show dialog? Must each "Account Name" be
   distinct?</B>  News and Mail accounts will have a distinct
   Account Name. SMTP will not have an account name. If the user
   doesn't specify an account name, we will provide one. It will be
   created using the account server name. 6/30/99.</LI>
   
   <LI><B>Local Mail directory and Local News directory. Are these
   per account or global? Where should they be located? Account
   Settings or Preferences (Mail and Newsgroups).</B> These will be
   per account. Located on the "Server" dialog. 6/30/99.</LI>
   
   <LI><B>"Ask me before downloading x messages". Is this per News
   account?</B> Per Account. 6/30/99.</LI>
   
   <LI><B>Is SSL secure (Mail) or encrypted (News) connection? (We
   describe it two diff ways currently).</B> "Secure". 6/30/99.</LI>
   
   <LI><B>News Server Settings: Which password method is correct (see
   dialog)? Currently, the Edit version is different than the New
   version.</B> Use single checkbox method. 6/30/99.</LI>
   
   <LI><B>Does News Identity need an "Advanced" dialog as well?
   </B>No.<B> </B>6/30/99.</LI>
   
   <LI><B>SMTP Servers: These need "Account Name" as well? </B>No.
   6/30/99.</LI>
   
   <LI><B>Congratulations dialogs. Shouldn't the web dialogs be the
   same as the client dialogs? If so, can the additional info, "Login
   Name", "Email Address" and "http://..." be added?</B> Dialogs will
   be the same. Summary info will be provided where appropriate.
   6/30/99.</LI>
   
   <LI><B>Do we need a "Log into this account at startup" option for
   each account? </B>Yes.</LI>
