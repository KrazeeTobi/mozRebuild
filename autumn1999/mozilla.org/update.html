    <h1 align=center>news from the front</h1>

    <center><a href="mailto:shaver@mozilla.org">Mike Shaver</a>,
      27-Jul-1999</center>
    <p>

    At the time of this writing, the dust has settled around <a
    href="project/seamonkey/release-notes/m8.html">M8</a>, which puts us almost halfway
    through the milestone list for <a href="projects/seamonkey/milestones/">SeaMonkey</a>
    (a.k.a Mozilla 5.0).  The Mozilla developers are progressing well
    on the new architecture described in Brendan's <a
    href="../../roadmap.html">roadmap</a>, and it's time to take
    another look at where we are.  The roadmap has stood up well as a
    description of our technical flight plan; this document should
    help plot our current position in organizational terms.

    <p>

    Additionally, there has been a fair amount of talk in the press
    (print and pixel), slashdot and the like about the state and
    health of the project, so with the help of some new statistics
    I'll share my thoughts on those topics.

    <h2> a word about terminology </h2>
    
    Throughout this document, the term <i>external</i> will be used to
    describe someone who isn't paid by Netscape or AOL.  It's a
    perhaps-unfortunate term, because all Mozilla developers are
    equally ``internal'' to the project, but it's well-understood
    shorthand for ``not paid by Netscape or AOL'' and no other terms
    recommend themselves immediately as clearer and simpler.  It's
    true that there are Mozilla architecture meetings and the like
    hosted on the Netscape campus; Mozilla's pre-history and the
    number of Netscape engineers working on Mozilla makes it more
    practical to do so.  Anyone interested in attending is welcome to,
    of course, either in person or by telephone.  This is true whether
    you're paid by Netscape or not: I live and work thousands of
    kilometres from the Netscape campus, so I rely on telephone or
    just read the minutes afterwards.

    <h2> legion of mozilla </h2>

    Grovelling through the <a href="../../bonsai.html">bonsai</a>
    database produces some not-entirely-surprising statistics.  For
    the month of June, there were 125 different people checking code
    in, of whom 108 had email addresses ending in
    <tt>netscape.com</tt> or <tt>mozilla.org</tt>, and they
    checked in 53 patches of varying sizes on behalf
    of people without direct CVS access (``<a
    href="#indirect">indirect checkins</a>'').
<p>    
    The M7 milestone and month of June brought us some encouraging
    numbers about the Mozilla community in addition to the developers:
    <ul>

      <li> Unique posters in the mozilla newsgroups and mailing lists
      is up to 1049 in the month of June, and we've been averaging 990
      a month since January.  (Tragically, that number includes a
      small group of spammers.)</li>

      <li> Those thousand-or-so posters generated 6215 posts in June,
      up more than 50% from the January total of 4017. </li>

      <li> When they're not posting to the newsgroups, lots of people
      are giving the software a spin: the four weeks of M7 saw 52,199
      downloads of pre-built binaries for Windows, Macintosh, Linux
      and OS/2 from ftp.mozilla.org alone (statistics from our 100+
      mirrors aren't readily available).  In addition, the M7 source
      was pulled from our FTP site 2022 times. </li>

      <li> The bug reporting and fixing rate for June was good, too:
      in addition to the efforts of Netscape's QA team, 584 bugs were
      reported by ``external'' testers<super><a
      href="#foot1">[1]</a></super>.</li>

      <li> B10K: we hit 10000 bug reports and enhancement requests in
      <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org">bugzilla</a> in June,
      including those migrated from the internal Netscape bug
      database.  (I should point out that the 10000-plus number counts
      all reports filed in bugzilla, including resolved bugs,
      enhancement requests and ``virtual bugs'' used for dependency
      tracking.)</li>

    </ul>

    In addition, some contributors aren't represented by our stats.
    As an example, participants in the recent <a
    href="http://www.mozilla.org/newlayout/bugathon.html">BugAThon
    300</a> were usually making changes to bugs (adding test cases)
    rather than filing new ones, so they don't show up in our above
    June-bug count.  Their efforts are certainly valuable, and 
    will make many of our bugs easier to fix and verify, so we should
    work on capturing data about that sort of contribution.

    <h2> isn't that a lot of netscape? </h2>

    There are indeed a lot of people paid by Netscape/AOL to
    work on Mozilla, including yours truly. Some people, including a
    hearty number of journalists, conclude from that fact that Mozilla
    isn't an open development effort, or that nobody but Netscape
    cares about the fate of the project.  I think those are pretty
    silly conclusions to draw, and here's why:
    <blockquote>
      If Netscape were to take all but 20 of those developers off of
      Mozilla, external developers would outnumber internal by a
      fair amount.  But would that really improve the openness or
      health of the project?  Would it mean that more people outside
      Netscape cared about Mozilla?  Of course not; in fact, the loss
      of 80-odd developers would set Mozilla back, as would
      be the case with most open source projects.
      <p>
      So if having a smaller number of Netscape developers wouldn't
      make Mozilla a better project, why would their significant
      development contribution make it a worse one?  I think it's
      pretty clear that the ``internal to external'' ratio isn't a
      useful metric for determining how much interest the open source
      community has in Mozilla, or for gauging the health of the
      project.
    </blockquote>

    <h2> what do those numbers mean? </h2>
    
    One of the hard parts of interpreting these numbers is figuring
    out how to quantify contributions: a ``checkin'' can represent a
    pretty wide range of effort, as can a ``bug report''.  (Regardless
    of the width of that spectrum, we're obviously pleased to have the
    help of anyone who wants to contribute.)

    <p>

    Another hard part is that some of our numbers are incomplete: it's
    hard to generate good statistics for things like CVS
    checkouts/updates, and we don't have ready access to logs for our
    FTP mirror sites.  (Looks like we had 19158 fresh CVS checkouts in
    June, but the CVS logging facilities make it pretty much
    impossible to count the number of updates, or even the number of
    unique hosts.)

    <p>

    All that hedging aside, and considering rougher historical numbers
    not included in this document, the general trend is toward
    larger numbers of developers, increased bug reporting and fixing
    rates, and ever-growing downloads.  (As an example, we're not
    through July yet, but there were already 5 new external owners
    added so far this month.) I think those are all good things for
    the health of the project, personally.

    <p>

    I also think that looking at the rates of change will be
    interesting, so I'm looking forward to putting together the
    numbers for July/M9 and comparing.  Also, I've been mostly
    unsuccessful at finding examples of similar metrics for other
    open-source projects.  If anyone reading this knows of such a
    thing, I'd love to <a
    href="mailto:shaver@mozilla.org?subject=metrics">hear about
    it</a>.  The Mozilla project at large -- contributors, users,
    testers, the <tt>*@mozilla.org</tt> infrastructure folk and other
    interested parties -- should maybe have a <a
    href="news://news.mozilla.org/netscape.public.mozilla.general">discussion</a>
    about which numbers matter to us most.

    <h2> petty details </h2>

    <a name="indirect">``indirect external checkins''</a> refer to
    patches that were committed to the tree, but which were developed
    by a contributor without CVS access.  This figure is virtually
    always going to be inaccurately low, because it relies on pattern
    matching for email addresses in the CVS commit messages, and some
    contributions make it in unattributed (oops!)  or attributed by
    name rather than email address.<p>

    <a name="foot1">[1]</a> Of the 584 bugs reported in June, 245 were
    resolved as WORKSFORME, DUP or INVALID, leaving 339 to be fixed or
    perhaps reclassified in the future.
