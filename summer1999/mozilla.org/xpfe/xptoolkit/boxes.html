<font color=red>[This spec is my own interpretation of how boxes work. If I'm wrong
about anything, please bring it to my attention.  You may have discovered a bug in boxes,
or I may have misinterpreted something. - Dave]</font>
<p>
<h3>The Basics</h3>
The box is a special kind of container used primarily for laying out controls within dialogs
and windows. Boxes lay out their children using a constraint-based system in which both 
relative sizing and intrinsic sizing of controls are supported.
Boxes are ideal for a layout in which the size of the controls
could change (e.g., because of localization changes or skin changes).
<p>
The box is specified using the <font color=green>box</font> tag. Boxes come in two flavors: 
the horizontal box and the vertical box.  The horizontal box lays out
its children horizontally (left to right), and the vertical box stacks its children vertically
(top to bottom). 
<p>
The <font color=red>align</font> attribute can be used to dictate whether or not the box is
<font color=orange>horizontal</font> or <font color=orange>vertical</font>.  If the <font color=red>align</font>
attribute is omitted, the box is assumed to be horizontal.
<p>
<table align=center width=80% border=1 bgcolor=#d0d0d0>
<tr><td>
<pre>
&lt;box align="horizontal"&gt;
     &lt;titledbutton value="Child 1"/&gt;
     &lt;titledbutton value="Child 2"/&gt;
&lt;/box&gt;
</pre>
<center><img src="boxes/box1.gif"></center> 
<p>
</table>
<p>
When items are placed in a box without specifying any additional information about their size,
then the box will flow the children <i>intrinsically</i>.  In other words, the box will ask each
child how big its needs to be, and then it will make the child that size.  Notice that in
the above example, the two buttons are only as big as they need to be to display all of their text.
<p>
Widths can be specified for items inside a horizontal box.  When an object specifies its width in
pixels or in ems, it is telling the box that it would like to be that width.  Percentage
widths are meaningless inside a horizontal box.
Similarly, heights can be specified for items in a vertical box.  The component is indicating its
preferred height. Percentage heights are likewise meaningless inside a vertical box.
<p>
It is generally the case that specifying percentage widths or heights on children of a box
(regardless of its alignment) is
meaningless and should be avoided.  <font color=red>[In fact, it currently appears that such a specification
can cause problems, so make sure that if you're using boxes, you don't use percentage widths and
heights on the direct children of the box.]</font>
<p>
<table align=center width=80% border=1 bgcolor=#d0d0d0>
<tr><td>
<pre>
&lt;box&gt;
     &lt;titledbutton style="width: 200px" value="Child 1"/&gt;
     &lt;titledbutton style="width: 100px" value="Child 2"/&gt;
&lt;/box&gt;
</pre>
<center><img src="boxes/box2.gif"></center> 
<p>
</table>
<p>
In the above example, the first child is twice as wide as the second child, since it asked to
be 200 pixels wide.  The second child asked to be only 100 pixels wide.
<p>
<h3>Flex</h3>
Objects in boxes fall into two categories: <i>flexible</i> and <i>inflexible</i>.  Inflexible
objects will not grow, even when there is extra space left over in the box.  
<p>
<table align=center width=80% border=1 bgcolor=#d0d0d0>
<tr><td>
<pre>
&lt;box style="width: 400px;"&gt;
     &lt;titledbutton style="width: 200px" value="Child 1"/&gt;
     &lt;titledbutton style="width: 100px" value="Child 2"/&gt;
&lt;/box&gt;
</pre>
<center><img src="boxes/box3.gif"></center> 
<p>
</table>
<p>
By default all objects in a horizontal box are the same height, that of the tallest child in the box.
In a vertical box, by default, all objects are the same width, that of the widest child in the box.
<p>
<table align=center width=80% border=1 bgcolor=#d0d0d0>
<tr><td>
<pre>
&lt;box align="vertical"&gt;
     &lt;titledbutton value="Cat"/&gt;
     &lt;titledbutton value="Piranha"/&gt;
     &lt;titledbutton value="Antidisestablishmentarianism"/&gt;
&lt;/box&gt;
</pre>
<center><img src="boxes/box4.gif"></center> 
<p>
</table>
<p>
An object becomes flexible when the <font color=red>flex</font> attribute is placed on the element.
Objects that are flexible can shrink or grow as the box shrinks and grows.  Whenever there is extra
space left over in a box, the flexible objects are expanded to fill that space.  
Flex is specified as a numerical value.  All flex is relative.  For example, a child 
with a flex of 2 is twice as flexible as a child with a flex of 1.
<p>
Let's take a look at what happens with flexible objects when there is extra space left over.
<p>
<table align=center width=80% border=1 bgcolor=#d0d0d0>
<tr><td>
<pre>
&lt;box align="vertical" style="height: 200px"&gt;
     &lt;titledbutton value="Cat"/&gt;
     &lt;titledbutton flex="1" value="Piranha"/&gt;
     &lt;titledbutton value="Antidisestablishmentarianism"/&gt;
&lt;/box&gt;
</pre>
<center><img src="boxes/box5.gif"></center> 
<p>
</table>
<p>
In the above example, the box is 200 pixels tall, which is more than enough room for the three
buttons.  Because the first and third buttons are inflexible, they remain the same size as in
the previous example.  The second button is specified as being flexible, and because it is the only
flexible object in the box, it receives all of the extra space.
<p>
When several objects in a box are flexible, the extra space is divided among the objects based on
how flexible they are.  The box determines how much space to give an object by adding up the
flex values on all of its children.  An object gets an amount of extra space equal to the
percentage of flex that it is responsible for.
<p>
For example, if two objects have a flex of 1, then the first object gets 1/(1+1) = 1/2 of the extra
space, and the second object also gets 1/2 of the extra space.
<p>
<table align=center width=80% border=1 bgcolor=#d0d0d0>
<tr><td>
<pre>
&lt;box align="vertical"&gt;
     &lt;titledbutton flex="1" value="Cat"/&gt;
     &lt;titledbutton flex="1" value="Piranha"/&gt;
&lt;/box&gt;
</pre>
</td>
<td><img src="boxes/box6.gif"></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
Here is another example using objects with different flex values.
<p>
<table align=center width=80% border=1 bgcolor=#d0d0d0>
<tr><td>
<pre>
&lt;box align="vertical"&gt;
     &lt;titledbutton flex="1" value="Cat"/&gt;
     &lt;titledbutton flex="2" value="Piranha"/&gt;
     &lt;titledbutton flex="3" value="Canary"/&gt;
&lt;/box&gt;
</pre>
</td>
<td><img src="boxes/box7.gif"></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
<h3>Preferred, Minimum, and Maximum Sizes</h3>
For inflexible objects, the specification of the <font color=purple>width</font> and
<font color=purple>height</font> properties can be used to hardcode an object's size.  If they
are omitted, an inflexible object will be sized intrinsically.
<p>
With flexible objects, there are more options.  Just as with inflexible objects, the
<font color=purple>width</font> and <font color=purple>height</font> properties can be used
to specify a preferred size.  However, unlike inflexible objects, this size is only a guideline.
The box code will stretch a flexible object as it sees fit. It will also shrink the object if
required until the object can shrink no more (e.g., when the object hits its minimum required
intrinsic size).
<p>
<table align=center width=80% border=1 bgcolor=#d0d0d0>
<tr><td>
<pre>
&lt;box align="vertical"&gt;
	 &lt;titledbutton flex="1" style="height:1000px" value="Cat"/&gt;
&lt;/box&gt;
</pre>
</td>
<td><img src="boxes/box8.gif"></td>
<td><img src="boxes/box9.gif"></td>
</tr>
</table>
<P>
In the above example the box is shrinking, and despite the specification of 1000 pixels as the
preferred height, the button, because it is flexible, shrinks with the box.  It continues to shrink
until the minimum required height for the button is reached.  After that, the button can shrink no
further.  If the box were to continue to shrink, the button's 
contents would be clipped, and a portion of the button would no longer be visible.
<p>
Components can therefore have their own notions of minimum and maximum intrinsic sizes.  For example,
the titled button was smart enough to know that it could not get any smaller than the minimum height
required to draw its borders and its text.  
<p>
For a more fine-grained control of minimum and maximum sizes, the <font color=purple>min-width</font>,
<font color=purple>min-height</font>, <font color=purple>max-width</font>, and 
<font color=purple>max-height</font> properties can be used.  When specified, they provide extra
information to the box as it shrinks and grows the object in question.
<p>
In a horizontal box, for example, if a minimum width is specified, then the flexible
object will not be
allowed to shrink below that width.  If a maximum width is specified, then the flexible
object will not be
allowed to grow beyond that width.
<p>
<table align=center width=80% border=1 bgcolor=#d0d0d0>
<tr><td colspan=2>
<pre>
&lt;box align="vertical"&gt;
  &lt;html:iframe flex="1" style="min-height:100px; max-height:300px; width:300px" 
  src="http://www.mozillazine.org/"/&gt;
&lt;/box&gt;
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><img src="boxes/box10.jpg"></td>
<td><img src="boxes/box11.jpg"></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
In the above example you can see <font color=purple>min-height</font> and <font color=purple>max-height</font>
in action. In the first screenshot the box has been shrunk until it is smaller than 100 pixels in
height. Because the iframe has a specified minimum height of 100 pixels, it is not allowed to 
shrink any further, and so as the box falls below 100 pixels, the iframe gets clipped, and portions
of it become invisible.
<p>
In the second screenshot, the box has been expanded past 300 pixels in height. Even though the box
is getting bigger, the extra space is not being consumed by the iframe, because its maximum height
of 300 pixels has been reached.  It will grow no further.
<p>
Below is another example illustrating min and max width.
<p>
<table align=center width=80% border=1 bgcolor=#d0d0d0>
<tr><td>
<pre>
&lt;box align="horizontal"&gt;
     &lt;titledbutton value="Child 1" flex="100%" style="max-width: 50px"/&gt;
     &lt;titledbutton value="Child 2" flex="100%" style="min-width: 50px"/&gt;
&lt;/box&gt;
<tr><td><center><img src="boxes/box12.gif"></center></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
In the above example, the box has been stretched so that it is very wide.  The first child has
a maximum width of 50 pixels, and it divides the excess space equally with the second child until its
maximum width has been reached.  After that, since it is not allowed to grow any further, the
remaining space all goes to the second child.
<p>
<h3>Nesting Boxes</h3>
It may help to remember that regardless of the kind of child you place inside a box, the above
basic rules continue to apply.  When a box is placed inside another box, it's no different than
placing anything else inside the box.  Like any other children of a box, a nested box
is either flexible or inflexible.  When inflexible it will size itself intrinsically if
no widths or heights are specified on it. If the size is specified on an inflexible
child, the child box will be that size.
<p>
The whole concept of boxes is that they are a very simple atomic layout managers. 
By themselves that are not that powerful but when nested you can achieve some complex layouts. 
Take this example.
<p>
<table align=center width=80% border=1 bgcolor=#d0d0d0>
<tr><td>
<pre>
&lt;box align="horizontal"&gt;
  &lt;spring flex="1"/&gt; 
  &lt;box align="vertical"&gt; 
    &lt;spring flex="1"/&gt; 
    &lt;titledbutton value="centered"/&gt;
    &lt;spring flex="1"/&gt; 
  &lt;/box&gt; 
  &lt;spring flex="1"/&gt; 
&lt;/box&gt;
</pre>
</td>
<td><img src="boxes/box13.gif"></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
In the above example the titled button is centered in the middle of the window. 
This is achieved by creating a horizontal box and putting a vertical box inside it. 
The vertical box contains a titledbutton. The magic here is how the vertical box and 
horizontal box are centered. This is done by using an invisible component called a 
<font color=green>spring</font>. (A spring is nothing special. 
In CSS it is just a block frame, akin to a <font color=green>div</font> in HTML).) 
By placing flexible springs before and after the vertical box and before and after the 
titled button we get a centering effect.  
<p>
<h3>Intrinsic Sizing of Windows and Dialogs</h3>
When windows and dialogs are opened in XUL, unless you specify a width and height for the
window (see <a href="windows.html">Windows and Dialogs</a>), the window will intrinsically
size itself around its content.
<p>
In XUL the outermost <font color=green>window</font> tag is a horizontal box.  It behaves
in every respect like the <font color=green>box</font> tag.  It can be turned into a vertical
box by using the <font color=red>align</font> attribute.
<p>
Through careful use of boxes, dialogs can be designed so that they come up as big as they
need to be but no bigger.  Such a design is handy for dialogs whose appearance might change
(thus necessitating a size change) because of a different skin or different locale (see
<a href="packages.html">Packages</a>).
<p>
There are certain caveats when building intrinsically sized dialogs.  The following rules are
guidelines to help ensure that you are using boxes correctly.
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Don't specify percentage widths and heights on objects that are direct children of
boxes.</b> It is meaningless to do so.  If you want to specify relative flexibility (e.g.,
one object takes up 20% of the space, and the other object takes up 80%), you can do so using
flex (e.g., flex="20" and flex="80").
<p>
<li><b>Constrain the width of <font color=red>html:div</font> tags used inside boxes.</b>
Divs are nothing more than blocks of text.  When sizing intrinsically, if the width of the
div is not constrained, all the text will run together on one line.  Be careful in general
about using paragraphs of text in dialogs and windows.  If you need to do so, make sure you
place a cap on the width of the div (max-width is good for this).
<p>
<li><b>Be careful about using percentage width/height in windows.</b> If you provide no hints
regarding maximum size, and only specify rules in terms of percentages, you're asking for
trouble.  50% of infinity (an unconstrained width) is still infinity.  If your dialogs are
coming up really tall or really wide, you're probably guilty of this.  You're probably
specifying percentages when you should be using flex instead.
</ul>
<p>
<h3>Which widgets are boxes?</h3>
Right now many of the other widgets are also boxes, and thus support the align attribute and
all of the other behavior described in this document.  These widgets include:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Window (horizontal)
<li>Toolbox (vertical)
<li>Toolbar (horizontal)
<li>Menu Bar (XP menu only, horizontal)
<li>Menu Popup (XP menu only, vertical)
<li>Tab Widget (see the spec.)
</ul>
<p>
<h3>Open Issues</h3>
<ul>
<li>Boxes will probably implement <font color=purple>vertical-align</font>
 at some point (like table cells do), so that
alignment along a box axis can be done without resorting to springs.
<li>Should flex move into CSS?
<li>When a box has excess space and contains only inflexible components, it draws its border
incorrectly. (It draws the border around only its children and doesn't include the excess space.)
