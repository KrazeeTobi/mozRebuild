<p>Personal Security Manager (PSM) is a client-independent desktop
security module. It performs PKI operations on behalf of desktop
client applications, including certificate and key management, SSL, S/MIME,
cryptographic token support, and centralized administration.
<h2>
PSM Components</h2>
The PSM suite consists of two major pieces: the PSM daemon
itself and the PSM client library. PSM itself is a daemon, running in
a separate process. Applications use PSM functionality by calling
the PSM client library, which communicates with PSM using an
RPC-like protocol over a local socket connection.

<p>
<h3>
The PSM Daemon</h3>
PSM itself is a daemon, running in a separate process. It performs
cryptographic operations, wraps client network traffic using SSL, and performs many
other kinds of PKI operations.
<h3>
The PSM Client Library</h3>
In order to use PSM, a client application must link with the PSM client
library. This library consists of several layers:
<h4>
The Transport Layer</h4>
This layer provides a reliable transport stream abstraction for connection
to PSM. The properties of the connection are:
<ul>
<li>
a reliable stream</li>

<li>
two way communication</li>

<li>
provides a file descriptor that can be used with select()</li>
</ul>
Possible implementations of the transport layer include TCP sockets, Unix
domain sockets, named pipes, and a shared memory transport (some operating
systems provide select()'able semaphores that can be used to implement
this). However, the transport layer in the PSM client library must
currently agree with the implementation used by PSM on the given platform.
<p>The transport layer is provided by the client application on a platform-dependent
basis:
<ul>
<li>
On Unix or Linux, the client socket function is expected to create a Unix domain
socket.</li>

<li>
On Windows, a TCP socket is expected.</li>

<li>
On MacOS (running Open Transport), a TCP socket/endpoint is expected.</li>
</ul>

<h4>
The Protocol Library</h4>
The protocol library encodes and decodes messages passed along the control
channel. The protocol library is shared between the client library and
the PSM daemon.
<p><b>The Client Library API</b>
<p>The client library API manages connections to PSM, and provides
client-side abstractions for objects and services contained within PSM.
Eventually, this API will grow to resemble a subset of the <a href="[NEED LINK HERE]">NSS API</a>,
with higher-level functions and UI facilities added for ease of integration.
<h2>
The PSM GUI</h2>
PSM may require user input to perform certain operations.  The application
may choose from one of two methods for dealing with these exceptional conditions. 
The application may allow PSM to use its own built-in HTML dialog-based 
GUI, which is similar to the security UI curently implemented in
Communicator. The other option [currently not implemented] is for
PSM to send messages back to the application requesting the information
required to continue.
<p>When PSM requires user feedback and it is configured to use the internal
HTML dialog-based GUI, the following process is used to display the dialog
and get back the results:
<ol>
<li>
If the NSS function running in PSM requires additional information to continue,
and it calls a callback function that has been registered to address the particular
exceptional condition.</li>

<li>
The callback function sends a message to the client application requesting
an HTML window with the required dimensions, and a URL to be loaded into
the window. The URL points to a port on the local machine that is
serviced by PSM.</li>

<li>
The client application creates a window of the requested dimensions that
is capable of displaying HTML, and loads the requested URL.</li>

<li>
The HTTP request for the URL is sent to a port on the local machine that
is serviced by PSM. The URL provides enough information to PSM for
it to generate the correct HTML stream for the dialog.</li>

<li>
The HTML is displayed in the window by the application.</li>

<li>
The user provides the required input to the dialog and submits it.</li>

<li>
The URL for submitting the dialog's form data also points to the PSM HTTP
port on the local machine.</li>

<li>
PSM accepts the form post, and returns a response to the application that
will cause the dialog window to be closed.</li>

<li>
The required information is extracted from the posted response and returned
to NSS so that the original operation may be completed.</li>
</ol>
Use of the internal GUI requires that the application have the ability
to display HTML in a window. Non-browser applications may still take
advantage of the built-in GUI by using an available HTML display component.
<h2>
The PSM Protocol</h2>
The application communicates with PSM using an RPC-like protocol over a
control channel. In addition to this control channel, there may be
several data channels in use to pass bulk data to and from PSM.
<p>When the application starts up, or (in the case of Mozilla) when
the https module is loaded for the first time, it initializes the PSM client
library. The client library will start PSM if it is not already running,
and then open a control channel to it. Each application will have
its own control channel to PSM and will require separate authentication
for access to the resources controlled by PSM. PSM will [eventually]
be able to support a large number of applications at one time, though at
the moment, only one at a time is supported. (There is some infrastructure
within PSM itself to support multiple clients; as NSS exposes
multi-client functionality, PSM will follow suit.)
<p>In addition to the control channel, several data channels may be in
use by a particular application at any one time. These data channels
will be used for bulk data transfer, such as SSL connections, operations
on cryptographic messages (PKCS #7 and S/MIME), or any other operation
that requires transfer of a large amount of data to PSM.
<p>The PSM protocol is described in detail in another document <font color="#FF0000">[forthcoming]</font>. 
In brief, it supports the following types of operations:
<ul>
<li>
Cryptographic operations</li>

<li>
Connection management for bulk data connections used for cryptographic
operations, including basic crypto, PKCS #7, and SSL</li>

<li>
Messages to manipulate and query objects maintained by PSM such as certificates,
trust information, tokens, keys, etc.</li>

<li>
GUI management messages</li>

<li>
Status reporting</li>

<li>
Messages reporting exceptional conditions requiring some data from the
application or user</li>
</ul>
