<center><h1>Mozilla at One: A Look Back and Ahead</h1></center>

<center><a href="mailto:hecker@netscape.com">Frank Hecker</a>, 02-Apr-1999</center>

<p>Now that mozilla.org and the open-source Mozilla project are a year
old, it's an appropriate time to look back at the experience thus far:
what has been accomplished, what has not yet been done, what might
have been done differently, what lessons have been learned, and what
issues lie ahead. Below you'll find my personal opinions concerning these
topics.</p>

<h2>Highlights</h2>

Here are what I think are the major highlights of the last year,
things that worked out relatively well and constituted progress toward
the goals of mozilla.org and the Mozilla project:

<ul>
<li>Netscape and mozilla.org released a large body of code into the open-source
"pool," including
<ul>
<li><a href="source.html">source code for Mozilla</a>
itself, consisting of most of the code-in-progress for Netscape Communicator
5.0</li><p>

<li>source code for related software, including the
<a href="directory/">Directory SDKs</a> for
<a href="directory/csdk.html">C</a> and
<a href="directory/javasdk.html">Java</a>,
<a href="directory/perldap.html">PerLDAP</a>,
the Communicator
<a href="projects/cck/">Client Customization Kit</a>,
and a
<a href="js/">JavaScript reference implementation</a></li><p>

<li>several development tools useful for open-source projects, including the
<a href="bugs/">Bugzilla</a> bug tracking system
(now also <a href="http://developer.redhat.com/bugzilla/">used by Red Hat
Software</a>, among others), the <a href="bonsai.html">Bonsai</a>
system for monitoring CVS trees, and the <a href="tinderbox.html">Tinderbox</a>
build system</li><p>

<li>source code for "orphaned" technology no longer under active development
by Netscape, including the <a href="projects/ef/">Electrical
Fire</a> Java Virtual Machine (JVM) implementation and the Java-based <a href="projects/grendel/">Grendel</a>
mail/news client (thus ensuring that others might benefit from the code already
created)</li>
</ul>
</li><p>

<li>Netscape and mozilla.org created the
<a href="MPL/NPL-1.0.html">Netscape Public License</a>
(NPL) and the
<a href="MPL/MPL-1.0.html">Mozilla Public License</a>
(MPL) for <a href="MPL/">licensing
the Mozilla source release</a> and other code released by
Netscape. The licenses were created through a relatively public
process in which draft licenses were published and comments solicited;
partly as a result, the final NPL and MPL 1.0 were accepted by the
bulk of open-source developers as reasonable licenses balancing the
interests of Netscape and the larger community of developers and
users.  The NPL and MPL have also influenced new licenses created for
other open-source projects. Note also that the NPL and MPL have recently been
revised to address concerns about their patent clauses; see the
<a href="MPL/NPL-1.0M.html">revised licenses</a>
for more information.
(The revised licenses also allow for the possibility of licensing code under
both the NPL/MPL and an alternate license such as the GPL;
mozilla.org will use this to release the JavaScript
reference implementation under dual licenses so it can be used
by more projects.  There are no plans to release Mozilla code this way.)</li><p>

<li>Early "developer preview" releases of <a href="binaries.html">Mozilla
binaries</a> (including the recently-released "<a href="projects/seamonkey/release-notes/">M3
version</a>") have provided a "plausible promise" of a fast, cross-platform,
<a href="newlayout/faq.html#Which open standards">standards-compliant</a>
web browser (as well as a <a href="mailnews/">mail/news
client</a> and <a href="editor/">HTML editor</a>)
with relatively small memory and disk footprints, that can be <a href="newlayout/doc/webwidget.html">embedded</a>
in other applications and cleanly extended to incorporate new <a href="projects/xpcom/">modules</a>,
modified <a href="xpfe/">user interfaces</a>, third-party
<a href="oji/">Java implementations</a>, and new
local and network <a href="rdf/doc/">data sources</a>.</li><p>

<li>The project has begun to attract major pieces of useful functionality
developed by outside contributors, such as the <a href="http://www.jclark.com/xml/expat.html">expat
XML parser</a> (from <a href="mailto:jjc@jclark.com">James Clark</a>) and
the <a href="http://www.iol.ie/~locka/mozilla/mozilla.htm">Mozilla ActiveX
control</a> (from <a href="mailto:locka@iol.ie">Adam Lock</a>).</li><p>

<li>The first non-Netscape commercial product built on the Mozilla code base
has been announced: <a href="http://www.doczilla.com/">DocZilla</a>, a
tool for accessing SGML documents (and XML and HTML documents as well).</li><p>

<li>Netscape and mozilla.org have to a large degree opened up not just the
Mozilla code itself but also previously internal-only design <a href="community.html">discussions</a>
about how to move it forward -- an important achievement in terms of proving
the workability of the open-source development model at commercial software
companies that have previously developed only proprietary software. Those
who don't have time to read all the newsgroup discussions can also keep
track of happenings in the Mozilla project by reading <a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/">mozillaZine</a>,
an independent news site created by <a href="mailto:chrisn@statecollege.com">Chris
Nelson</a> to provide information on all things Mozilla-related,
as well as the Mozilla
<a href="newsbot/">newsbot</a>, which highlights significant threads in the Mozilla
newsgroups;
there are also many third-party web sites that have sprung up around the Mozilla
project.</li><p>

<li>mozilla.org has been able to move Mozilla to being based more on
other open-source code, as opposed to depending on proprietary
technology for key functions. In particular the Mozilla project was
able to leverage the work of the
<a href="http://www.gtk.org/">GTK+ project</a>
to provide underlying technology for the new Mozilla
<a href="xpfe/">cross-platform front-end interface</a>.</li><p>

<li>Several independent efforts have started to <a href="ports/">port
Mozilla</a> to other platforms, with some of them now well along (for example,
the <a href="ports/os2/">OS/2 port</a> created by
<a href="mailto:mjf35@cam.ac.uk">John Fairhurst</a>, <a href="mailto:sobotka@axess.com">Henry
Sobotka</a>, and others).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Lowlights and Debatable Decisions</h2>

All has not been sweetness and light, however. The first (and by far
most important) "lowlight" is of course that the Mozilla
project has not yet resulted in a production release of Netscape
Communicator 5.0, or even an official public beta release of
Communicator. Were there any ways things could have been done
differently? Here are two possibilities (if nothing more) and
some of the thoughts and debates around them:

<ul>

<li>Netscape and mozilla.org could have proceeded on the original plan
to release "Mozilla Classic," i.e., a version of Mozilla using the
original Communicator 5.0 source code, instead of <a
href="roadmap.html">rewriting Mozilla</a> using
the new NGLayout HTML layout engine (a major component of the new
Gecko technology). This might have produced an official 5.0 release
sooner and (as a side effect) resulted in having much earlier a
relatively stable code base buildable by more developers; however this
would have been at the cost of having a level of standards compliance
not much above that of the Communicator 4.x releases. Many web
developers, including those associated with the <a
href="http://www.webstandards.org/">Web Standards Project</a>,
expressed the <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/ng.txt">strong
opinion</a> that Netscape should not release a 5.0 product without
complete compliance with as many web standards as possible, including
at a minimum HTML 4.0 and CSS1. Netscape and mozilla.org therefore
decided to drop the existing layout code and
instead use NGLayout, even though at the time NGLayout was quite a
ways from final release, and thus the overall Communicator 5.0
schedule would slip at least a few months (especially given that many
other parts of Mozilla would have to be rewritten to use the new
NGLayout APIs).

<p>Would it have been possible to first do a Mozilla Classic-based
Communicator 5.0 release and then develop a Gecko-based follow-on
release (5.x or 6.0) in the same overall time it will end up taking to
do a Gecko-based Communicator 5.0? It's impossible to know for sure;
however such a plan would have arguably created real and significant
risks in terms of the length of the development schedule and the
complexity of the development process, especially if the two releases
were developed in parallel or nearly so.</li><p>

<li>Netscape could have skipped development work on the Communicator
4.5 release (created using the traditional internal-only development
process, with proprietary source code) and gone straight for 5.0; this
would have freed up many of the developers (especially mail/news
developers) who were working on 4.5 and allowed them to contribute
much earlier to the Mozilla/5.0 effort.  This problem was an unfortunate consequence
of the fact that the 5.0 release was not complete and working at the time it was
originally made available through mozilla.org, so that the Mozilla project was
initially
dependent on the activities of 
Netscape developers to produce a complete release.  This led to a situation
where there was a possible conflict between Netscape's business
priorities as a commercial software company and mozilla.org's
priorities as coordinator of an open-source project.
However, putting aside for a moment
Netscape's market needs for a 4.5 release, would it have helped the
Mozilla schedule that much to have the 4.5 developers working on
Mozilla and 5.0 instead? Or were there other items (like NGLayout)
gating the Mozilla/5.0 schedule? Space and time don't permit
discussing here all of the complexities of this issue.</li>
</ul>

Another perceived lowlight has been the pace at which 
outside developers have been attracted to work on Mozilla project.
To some extent the issue here is people's expectations; it's unclear whether the
number of outside Mozilla developers is that small relative to other
open-source projects of comparable complexity and at equally early
points in their development. The fact that Communicator development
had been going on for four years prior to release of the source is
arguably irrelevant, since any developers outside Netscape had to
start from scratch on 1 April 1998 in terms of their Mozilla learning
curve.  In any case, here are some of the ideas that have been
advanced as to why thousands of people are not currently hacking on
Mozilla (in the sense of contributing new code):

<ul>
<li>There was, at least initially, a very steep learning curve for
developers wishing to do
serious Mozilla hacking. There is a lot of code in terms of number of
lines and number of source files, the code is very complex, being a
mix of C and C++ with additional things like JavaScript thrown in for
good measure, and there was not very much introductory documentation
to orient new developers, at least at the start. The situation with
regards to introductory documentation is somewhat better now; in
particular the
<a href="http://www.doczilla.com/development/index.html">tutorial on
extending Mozilla</a> by
<a href="mailto:jst@citec.fi">Johnny Stenb&auml;ck</a> and
<a href="mailto:hto@citec.fi">Heikki Toivonen</a>
provides a good introduction to the complete novice.</li><p>

<li>For much of the project's life Mozilla has been very hard to build
from scratch, especially for new developers with no previous build
experience at Netscape.  The build system has often been in flux, was
not well-documented, and is pretty complex. On the plus side, the new
<a href="projects/autoconf/">autoconf-based
build system</a> (contributed by
<a href="mailto:cls@seawood.org">Christopher Seawood</a>) brings the
Mozilla project much more in line with current practice for
open-source projects developing on Linux, and it is now significantly
easier for new developers to get working builds on the
<a href="build/unix.html">Linux/Unix</a>,
<a href="build/win32.html">Microsoft Windows</a>,
and <a href="build/mac.html">Apple Macintosh
PowerPC</a> platforms.</li><p>

<li>The Mozilla code base has been in continual flux and as a result builds
on any given day have had wildly varying levels of stability. Because many
of the technologies used in the current Mozilla architecture (for example,
<a href="projects/xpcom/">XPCOM</a> and XPToolkit)
are still in active development and because of the difficulty of doing
truly portable cross-platform code, there have been relatively few stable
points thus far at which Mozilla both builds and runs on all the major platforms
of interest (Win32, Linux, and Mac). Like ease of building, stability is also
improving slowly but surely as newer "milestone" releases appear, like
the most recent "M3" release.</li><p>

<li>For a while there was little (and in some cases no) documentation
for the underlying Mozilla architecture and implementation details,
and much of the documentation that did exist was either obsolete or
badly out of date. This situation is improving, as most if not all of
the major Mozilla areas now have at least some internal documentation;
however the documentation will not be able to stabilize until the
underlying implementations stabilize.</li><p>

<li>Netscape did not make the Mozilla code available under the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU General Public
License</a>, and based on the terms of the GPL code licensed under the
NPL or MPL could not be incorporated into a GPLed program. (The
reverse was and is true as well: GPLed code cannot be incorporated
into Mozilla.) As a result Mozilla code could not be used in free
software projects like <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</a> that
were incorporating browser functionality but were using the GPL for
all their code. These inconsistencies between the NPL/MPL and the GPL have
yet to be fully resolved.</li><p>

<li>Many people have the perception that Mozilla is still a "Netscape
project" and that therefore "outside" support is not needed nor even
wanted. This is an incorrect perception, but it's understandable why people
might have become confused about this: First, Netscape and
now AOL do have a significant business interest in having the
Mozilla project be successful, in order to provide a sound technology
base from which to develop the branded Netscape Communicator product
as well as to leverage for other possible AOL software and services;
thus Netscape has funded and AOL will continue to fund a large number
of Mozilla developers by providing them full-time employment. Mozilla developers
outside Netscape who are volunteers do not have the luxury of being
able to work on Mozilla full-time, and therefore until more companies
are funding Mozilla development it's possible that significant Mozilla
development will continue to be done mostly by Netscape developers.
Unfortunately the issue of Netscape
"dominating" Mozilla will likely remain to some extent a "no-win"
situation as far as AOL and Netscape are concerned. If AOL puts even
more funding and people into Mozilla development then it is open to
the charge that it is trying to dominate the project and direct it
solely to commercial ends; on the other hand if it were to back away
from direct support of Mozilla and rely much more on outside
developers then people would think that AOL had abandoned Mozilla or
was guilty of exploiting the work of volunteers for its own purposes
without giving anything back to the project. This problem is not
unique to AOL and Netscape, of course; similar tensions will be
present as other commercial companies move more into support, development,
and use of open-source software.
<p>
Also,
there has been a learning curve for Netscape developers themselves, in
terms of becoming comfortable and then competent at the task of doing
development "in the fishbowl," i.e., with all design discussions, code
checkins, and debugging conducted in the open; some of their actions
during this learning period (for example, not posting design proposals
for comment, or conducting discussions on Netscape-internal forums as
opposed to using public newsgroups and mailing lists) have contributed to
the perception that Mozilla is still a Netscape-only project.
Fortunately Netscape developers have for the most part learned
their open-source lessons and are now doing a better job of working
within a public project.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>

Everyone will take their own lessons away from the Mozilla experience;
here are some I think should be kept in mind:

<ul>

<li><b>There's a lot more to a project than writing code.</b> People
tend to focus on the number of people contributing code to Mozilla or
having access to the CVS tree; however the complete list of people
helping mozilla.org includes not just
<a href="owners.html">module owners</a> and other
contributors of code but also people
<a href="quality/">testing early builds</a> and
<a href="quality/bug-writing-guidelines.html">submitting
bug reports</a>, as well as people critiquing design decisions
relating to proposed feature sets, user interfaces, internal
implementations, and public APIs. Not all of those people are
necessarily going to be programmers, and of those who are programmers
not all are going to be contributing code. For example, several
developers have been testing the Mozilla code for use as an HTML
layout engine embedded in their application. They are not
changing or contributing to that code, but their advice and bug
reports help improve the code.</li><p>

<li><b>Quality is better than quantity.</b> Rather than having a
mass of relatively unskilled volunteers, it is better to have the help
of a few people who really know what they're doing in a particular
area. Judged against this criterion, the mozilla.org effort has
been very successful in attracting the support of several very
talented non-Netscape people, both as programmers and as informal
consultants. To take one major example, many of the world's
leading experts on Web standards (HTML 4.0, CSS, XML, etc.) have
contributed valuable advice and feedback on the implementation of
those standards in Mozilla; their help is a key reason why even in its
current immature state the Mozilla code is more standards-compliant
than any other browser available today.</li><p>

<li>To quote a hoary proverb, <b>"An ounce of prevention is worth a
pound of cure."</b> Traditionally Netscape did design
internally, produced internal alpha builds, and then released a public
beta, at which point the public was finally able to critique the
product and suggest improvements. Unfortunately, in many cases it was
too late at that point to make widely requested improvements, because
the developers
had already committed to a particular implementation design and the
product marketing folks were bound and determined to prevent them from
going back and starting over; otherwise the product would have never
shipped anywhere close to its projected release dates. Working in an
open-source mode has allowed Netscape to get useful feedback right up
front, in many cases before any code has been written, and change
plans according; such feedback has not only helped Netscape make
smarter decisions, it also (and even more important) has kept us from
making dumb ones. (A good example here was the decision to rearchitect
the product rather then try to struggle on using the old code
base.)</li><p>

<li><b>There is no
<a href="http://mathserv.math.sfu.ca/History_of_Math/Europe/Euclid300BC/euclidmain.html">"royal
road"</a> to open source for commercial software companies.</b> To
quote <a href="mailto:jwz@jwz.org">Jamie Zawinski</a>, you can't
"sprinkle [a project] with the magic pixie dust of 'open source,' and
have everything magically work." To elaborate, a company cannot simply
release source code, put a few newsgroups up, and expect distributed
development to magically self-organize; it will need to make a
sustained effort requiring various people's time and attention in
order to get a distributed open-source development effort to the point
where it can produce results. In Netscape's case this effort did
not end with the release of the source code on 31 March 1998; on the
contrary, it has been a continuing project to get
people used to "working in the fishbowl:" reading and participating in
the <a href="community.html">Mozilla
newsgroups</a>, <i>not</i> using Netscape-internal lists for
discussions that aren't in fact confidential, writing and publishing
documentation and proposals for the benefit of those not in their
immediate groups, and so on. I'm not talking just about developers
either; the effects of open-source development are spreading (or will
spread) outward in the corporation to also include quality assurance,
technical support, product marketing, and related functions.</li><p>

<li>In relation to the previous point, <b>it takes time to get a project ramped up
to full activity</b>, especially with regard to attracting large numbers of
participants outside the original group. For much of the past year the Mozilla
developers and mozilla.org have been working to address the core design and
implementation issues around the Mozilla code itself, as well as the mechanics of
converting an internal proprietary development project into a public open-source
project. Now that that groundwork has been laid more attention can be paid to
other areas where work is needed, like Mozilla testing by end users, more polished
releases in terms of installation and initial configuration, and so on.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Issues Going Forward</h2>

That the past is past is a given; we can't change the effects of
decisions already made and things already done. However there are
several issues outstanding today that may affect the future success of
the Mozilla project, and they're worth touching on here (with some
suggested forums for followup discussion):

<ul>

<li><b>Mozilla on small devices.</b> There is much excitement in the
press and elsewhere over the prospects for non-PC devices. Is the
Mozilla architecture as currently implemented capable of being
scaled down for truly small devices (e.g., PDAs, settop devices, cell
phones, and similar "information appliances")?  Are there possible
design changes we should be looking at now in order to help
make this easier? Or are outside developers going to be okay if
they simply proceed using the current code base? (There's a new
Mozilla newsgroup
<a href="news://news.mozilla.org/netscape.public.mozilla.small-devices">netscape.public.mozilla.small-devices</a>
for discussing these issues.)</li><p>

<li><b>Recruiting more developers.</b> What further steps need to be
taken to make it as pain-free as possible for developers to hack
Mozilla? The existing <a href="build/">build
instructions</a>, project
<a href="docs/">documentation</a>,
and <a href="http://www.doczilla.com/development/index.html">Mozilla
tutorial</a> are good steps in this direction; do they need further
supplementing? If so, what are the most important documents to create
or improve? (A suggested forum is
<a href="news://news.mozilla.org/netscape.public.mozilla.documentation">netscape.public.mozilla.documentation</a>.)
What about providing more stable releases and buildable versions: will
the current
<a href="projects/seamonkey/milestones/">milestone
plan</a> address this problem? (A suggested forum is
<a href="news://news.mozilla.org/netscape.public.mozilla.general">netscape.public.mozilla.general</a>.)</li><p>

<li><b>Security and cryptographic code.</b> As is well-known, the
<a href="crypto-faq.html">Mozilla security and
crypto code</a> was removed prior to release because of U.S. export
control regulations. Unfortunately both U.S. export control
regulations and the presence of third-party technology continue to prevent
AOL/Netscape from releasing a complete SSL and S/MIME implementation
for Mozilla. It would in theory be possible for AOL to release a
limited set of security source code, but this code could only be used by developers
in the U.S. and Canada, and would also require additional work and time to add
implementations of all the cryptographic algorithms required, some of
which are still subject to U.S. patents. Given these limitations, it's
unclear that doing such a limited security source release would serve any
useful purpose with regard to either AOL or the broader Mozilla
project; however as time goes on this may change. (A suggested forum is

<li><b>Increasing corporate involvement in Mozilla development.</b>
Usually people think of Mozilla developers as being either Netscape employees or
volunteers on the net. However as noted previously one commercial
company has already announced a product based on Mozilla code, and several
others are now involved in Mozilla development to one degree or
another. The core
<a href="mission.html">mission</a>
of mozilla.org will continue to be to coordinate public Mozilla development and
be the steward of the public source tree; however that mission will include
not just working with net developers but also working with commercial companies
that wish to contribute code to the project and use Mozilla technologies in their
own products and services. Are there any things that mozilla.org could do to work
better with commercial companies while pursuing the core goals of the Mozilla project?
Are there things that mozilla.org could do to help net developers who want to do paid
Mozilla development work (e.g., as independent consultants or as employees of
other companies)?

Finally, there are always the issues of what will happen with the
Mozilla project now that the AOL/Netscape merger has been concluded,
and when AOL will fulfill the goal of shipping a branded Netscape
Communicator 5.0 release incorporating the Mozilla technology. Concerning
support of the Mozilla project, we have the
<a href="stevecase.html">expressions of
support</a> for Mozilla and mozilla.org by Steve Case and other AOL
executives, combined with the rational expectation that AOL would not
have acquired and be funding development efforts that it doesn't have
any use for. As for release of Communicator 5.0, anyone who wishes
will be able to track the progress of Mozilla development literally on
a day-to-day basis, whether it being monitoring

you'll know almost as much about how things are going as we will.

<p>The Mozilla project goes beyond just AOL and Netscape though; as
many people have commented, "the code is out there" now and in a sense
belongs to everyone. As such its prospects can be improved not just by
the work of AOL and Netscape, but by the help of anyone who sees its
value and wants to

look forward to working with all of you.
