# This file is used to generate the performance laundry list using
# the ``laundry-list.pl'' script. Its format is as follows, with
# tabs used to separate fields:
#
# A line beginning with a '*' is major performance grouping that is
# under the purview of a specific module owner:
#
# * Module Foo	owner@mozilla.org
#
# A line beginning with a '-' is a specific user-level task that
# occurs within the module. The task has an engineering contact
# primarily responsible for the work, a QA contact for measurement and
# data collection, and a netscape client product marketing owner
# responsible for setting a reasonable goal.
#
# - Task Blat	eng@mozilla.org	qa@mozilla.org	cpm@netscape.com
#
# Individual tasks fall under the purview of a performance grouping.
#
# A line beginning with a tab is a specific bug that represents work
# to be done to improve the performance of a user-level task, along
# with a high-level comment on that task
