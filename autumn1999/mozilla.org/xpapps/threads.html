<BR>Where we are

<P>This document describes the thoughts on threading issues for SeaMonkey
and beyond. This is a preliminary design proposal and outcome of a meeting
that was held this week.
<BR>
<H2><U>Threads in SeaMonkey:</U></H2>

The&nbsp; current plan for 5.0 for all&nbsp; major platforms (Windows,
Mac, Unix)&nbsp; is to have one UI thread and one or more netlib threads.
Processing that occurs in the UI thread includes, parsing, Creation of
Content model, layout, DOM activity, incremental &amp; resize reflows,
UI event loop, callbacks&nbsp; and plugins.&nbsp; The netlib threads are
responsible only for network activities.&nbsp; All the major platforms
use NSPR module to create the threads.&nbsp; There are 2 things about using
NSPR to create and manage threads&nbsp; that should not be confused.
<OL>
<LI>
To Use the NSPR threads API

<LI>
To Use, user level threads created by NSPR&nbsp; or to use native platform
threads created for you by NSPR.
</OL>
All platforms use the NSPR APIs to create their threads for the obvious
reason of portability, but not all platforms use NSPR user threads. The
issues are described in the next section. You can learn more about NSPR

<A HREF="../docs/refList/refNSPR/">here</A>
<BR>
<H1><U>Platform Issues:</U></H1>

One of the main concerns that were raised in the meeting was,&nbsp; platform
support for multiple UI threads and the possibility of having multiple
UI threads.
<H3><U><FONT COLOR="#000000">Unix:</FONT></U></H3>

Unix, currently&nbsp; supports only one UI thread because the underlying
libraries Xlib, gtk, Xt, motif are not thread safe.&nbsp; Any situation
that necessitates multiple threads to access the X libraries (like Java)
has to go through a locking mechanism that will make sure, only one thread
accesses X at any given time.&nbsp; This is the solution, communicator
versions 2+ have used.&nbsp;&nbsp; The granularity of the lock is a key
factor in deciding which threads to use. NSPR user threads or Native threads.
? Unix Communicator 4.5&nbsp; uses NSPR user threads and the XLock mechanism
is tightly integrated in NSPR.
<H4>Threads in unix for 5.0:</H4>

For 5.0 the current consideration is to continue to use NSPR user threads
for 1 UI thread one or more netlib threads to take care of the above situation
with Java or any other plugin that may access the X libraries.
<H4>Threads in unix beyond 5.0:</H4>

The Unix team is however very keen in moving the Xlock&nbsp; mechanism
out of NSPR&nbsp;&nbsp; to a higher level.&nbsp; This will enable unix
to use Native threads (which is pthreads in most platforms) which has other
developmental advantages&nbsp; like easy to debug, ability to interact
with other&nbsp; software components etc....&nbsp; This will also enable
unix to have&nbsp; multiple&nbsp; NSPR UI threads with their own nsGUIEvent
message pumps and all access to the underlying X/rendering layer
controlled through the Xlock.&nbsp;&nbsp; The unix team may consider moving
the xlock out of NSPR for 5.0 depending on how OJI&nbsp;will live in SeaMonkey.
To learn more about the Xlock issues and java, you can look <A HREF="http://www.mozilla.org/unix/using-x-with-mozilla-threads.html">here.</A>
<H3><U><FONT COLOR="#000000">Windows:</FONT></U></H3>

Windows is inherently capable of having multiple UI threads and a native
event loop per thread. Though this is a great advantage, its usage
with other modules of SeaMonkey which are not currently thread safe is
in question.&nbsp; In order to have the model where each&nbsp; toplevel
window runs in its own&nbsp; thread, we need to have most of the webshell
interfaces, DOM, XPFE widgets, to be thread safe and we are not there yet.
<H4>Threads in windows for 5.0:</H4>

So, considering all the new work that needs to be done to get to this mode,
for 5.0, windows will also support only one UI thread for the complete
application and multiple netlib threads. Windows will use the NSPR threads
API to create native threads for its needs.
<BR>
<H3><B><U><FONT COLOR="#000000">Mac:</FONT></U></B></H3>

The current implementation, and future plan for threading on MacOS lies with
NSPR threads. The Mac implementation of NSPR threads is a user level and non
preemptive. It does not rely upon the MacOS Thread Manager. Should it ever
become advantageous and plausible to utilize pthreads on top of Mach in
System X, or the Thread Manager as the implementation of MacOS NSPR threads,
the issue can be revisited.

<P>Since NSPR threads on MacOS are not preemptive, it allows us to control
reentrancy and locking issues more easily. In short, the fact that many MacOS
Toolbox calls are not thread safe can be dealt with by choosing carefully
what to lock, and where to yield control of a thread for a possible context
switch.

<H4>Performance of Threads on MacOS</H4>

How well threads perform on MacOS vs. other, preemptive platforms depends
largely upon how effectively yield calls are placed in code. On a preemptive
system, a yield call may either be a no-op or a true yield (I'm not sure
off the top of my head what it is in NSPR for Win and Unix).

<P>The NSPR thread scheduling policy for MacOS threads can also be adjusted
to give preference to threads which have events pending in their event
queues for lower event response latency.

<P>NSPR file I/O on the Mac can be better integrated with NSPR threads
to provide better performance. For example, a thread that was blocked on
file I/O but is now ready to run can be giving a higher priority in the
scheduling policy. This is commonly done on some unix systems to improve
I/O performance. Also, NSPR file I/O can do speculative look ahead buffering
to improve the performance of sequential file reads of the same byte size.
This sort of operation is very common throughout the code base. Speculative
read ahead buffering allows the sequential file reads of the same or smaller
size to return immediately without doing a context switch. I have many
of these changes that I made during the Gromit project but never checked
in. I'm planning on giving Wan-Teh and the NSPR team these changes Real
Soon Now for possible integration.
<BR>
<H4>Threads on MacOS in Netscape 5.0</H4>

MacOS will have just as many NSPR threads as other OSes, one UI thread,
and one or more NetLib threads. Very little will be different on MacOS
than any other platform in this model other than their non-preemptive nature.
<H4>Threads on MacOS beyond 5.0</H4>

In the future if we have more UI threads, code can be added to have event
dispatching from the Mac application's main event loop to the proper thread
event queue. This sort of marshaling would allow the MacOS platform differences
to be further abstracted out, and more code to be written in an XP fashion.
Again, performance concerns could be addressed within the MacOS NSPR thread
scheduler.
<H2><U>Modal Dialogs:</U></H2>

The current proposal to implement modal dialogs is&nbsp; this setup is
to have a mutex&nbsp; that will allow layout module to finish up any
layout or reflow operation that may be in progress and then bring up the
Modal dialog.&nbsp; As long as the modal dialog is up,&nbsp; layout will
interact only with it.
