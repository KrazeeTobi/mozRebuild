<p><i>Editor: This is where will talk about how one goes about contributing code 
  to EF, legal mumbo-jumbo and development motherhood. At the moment, it's more 
  of an outline than a document that someone would actually want to read. </i></p>
<h2>Contributions</h2>
<p>In order to remain free of legal encumbrances, ElectricalFire code must not 
  be derived from Sun's JVM code (or any other code not compatible with ElectricalFire's 
  <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/NPL/">Netscape Public License</a>). The <a href="http://www.classpath.org/">ClassPath</a> 
  project imposes similar <a href="http://www.classpath.org/docs/hacking.shtml#SEC2">restrictions</a> 
  on contributions.</p>
<p>Never under any circumstances refer to Sun's JDK source code while working 
  on ElectricalFire. In fact, it is best if you have never looked at Sun's code 
  at all. If you have any reason to believe that your code might be "tainted", 
  please say something on the newsgroup before trying to contribute it.</p>
<p><i>Editor: If some people will be working on interfacing the JDK1.2 libraries 
  with EF under the new Community Licensing scheme, we'll need to be more exact 
  about the policy above and to remind developers that if they look at the JDK 
  sources, that they're barred from working on Classpath.</i></p>
