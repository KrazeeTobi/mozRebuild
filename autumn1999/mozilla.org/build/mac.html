<center><h1>Building Mac Mozilla</h1></center>

This page aims to be the complete source of information
for people building Mozilla on the Macintosh.  Please report deficiencies to
<a href="mailto:sfraser@netscape.com"><tt>sfraser@netscape.com</tt></a>.
Please do not email me with questions about how to do stuff, or suggestions for improving the build
process, or anything else that does not concern information on this page itself.  Such
questions should be posted to the newsgroup
<a href="news://news.mozilla.org/netscape.public.mozilla.mac">
<tt>netscape.public.mozilla.mac</tt></a>

<p>If you are a programmer on another platform, and you need
information to make your changes Macintosh-friendly, there
is a page just for you
<a href="mac-for-xp-folk.html">here</a>.

<h3>How it works now</h3>

<p>The build system is fully automated.
You have to set up a build environment by assembling pieces from
here or there, but after that,
you can check out and build all the projects with a single perl script.
The build system is still rapidly evolving, 
and is not idiot-proof, but should be usable.

<h3>Recent changes</h3>

<p>To find recently-added information quickly, click on the links
below, and look for this symbol: <img src="new3.gif" align=top>
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="#new990924">99/09/24</a>. Another XPIDL compiler info update.
	<li><a href="#new990913">99/09/13</a>. Fixed MenuSharing Toolkit URL, IC 2.0 SDK URL.
	<li><a href="#new990726">99/07/26</a>. XPIDL compiler is now part of the build.
</ul>


<h3>Future changes</h3>

<p>Read the newsgroup
<a href="news://news.mozilla.org/netscape.public.mozilla.mac">
<tt>netscape.public.mozilla.mac</tt></a>
daily. It's good for you, and tastes good, too.
<p>

<hr>

<h3>System Requirements</h3>

<p>To build and run Mozilla, you'll need a beefy Mac with at least 1Gb of disk space,
and 64Mb or more of memory. For serious development, we'd recommend a 300MHz 604 or G3
and 128Mb RAM.

<p>To run Mozilla, you must have MacOS 8.5 or later installed.

<p class="note">Note that there are some
bugs currently that cause things to malfunction if you have non-ASCII characters or slashes '/' in your
disk or folder names, for any of the folders in the hierarchy up to where the application
is running from.

<h3>Tools and resources</h3>

<p>Here is the list of software you have to have installed to build Mozilla on the Mac:
<p>
<table border="0">

	<tr valign=top>

		</td>
	</tr>

	<tr valign=top>
		<td align=right><p><a name = "new990726"><img src="new3.gif" align=top></a>
			<a href="ftp://ftp.metrowerks.com/pub/updates/CWPRO4/CodeWarrior_Plugin_SDK.sit.hqx">
			CodeWarrior Plugin SDK</a>
		</td>
		<td><p>Because the <tt>xpidl</tt> compiler is now compiled as part of the build process,
		you need the CodeWarrior Plugin SDK. Install this in the Mac OS Support folder.
		</td>
	</tr>

	<tr valign=top>
		<td align=right><p>
		<a href="ftp://ftp.apple.com/developer/Development_Kits/CIncludes-Libraries.3.2.sit.hqx">
			Universal Headers 3.2</a></td>
		<td><p>Mozilla requires Universal Headers 3.2 to build. If you haven't already obtained
		these, download and install in the appropriate folders in the Mac OS Support folder.
		</td>
	</tr>

	<tr valign=top>

		<td align=right><p>ToolServer</td>
		<td><p>From the CodeWarrior Pro CD.

			<p>Uncompress the StuffIt Archive for ToolServer.  
	The goal is to let ToolServer and MPW share the same Tools 
	directory so you don't need to have multiple versions of tools.  
		Do the following: 
			<ol>
				<li>Open ToolServer's Tools folder.  
					There should be one file called "RMetrowerks".
				<li>Move RMetrowerks to the Tools folder of MPW.  
					The MPW folder should be at "Metrowerks:Codewarrior MPW:MPW" 
					if you installed Codewarrior correctly.
				<li>Remove ToolServer's Tools folder.

				<li>Now create an alias of Tools folder in "CodeWarrior MPW" 
					and move it to your ToolServer folder.  Rename the alias 
					(probably called "Tools alias") as "Tools".

			<li>IMPORTANT: Make sure you only have one instance of
				ToolServer on your machine.  If the build script finds 
					the wrong one, the correct tools will not be found and
					strange things will happen.  
			</ol>
		<p class="note">Sometimes, problems can occur when CodeWarrior attempts to
		start up ToolServer. If you build appears to halt when building the stubs
		target of NSStdLib.mcp, this could be the problem. Often, simply clicking
		on the desktop to deactivate the IDE causes ToolServer to fire up properly.
		If this still does not work, try moving ToolServer to your startup volume.

<h4>Running Perl scripts</h4>

<p>Some folks use BBEdit and BBEdit perl
extensions as their build environment. This allows you to edit the build
scripts inside BBEdit, and use the extensions to run it inside MacPerl.
You can also use Alpha and its Perl mode to do the same
thing.

<p>You can even try to run the build scripts
from MPW, but some have reported that MPW perl tool often crashes.

<h3>Building Mac Mozilla the first time</h3>

<p><strong>Warning:</strong> You will be downloading tens of megabytes of source code.
If you are using a modem connection, be prepared for hours and hours of download time.

<p>Before pulling the source code, always make sure the Macintosh build column
on <a href="http://cvs-mirror.mozilla.org/webtools/tinderbox/showbuilds.cgi?tree=SeaMonkey&amp;hours=4&amp;nocrap=1">
tinderbox</a> is green.  Redness on tinderbox presages a pull that will not build.  If the
Macintosh build is showing red, You might as well go to a movie and try later.  You should add
this tinderbox link to your bookmarks, even to your personal toolbar.

<table>
<tr><td bgcolor="#DDDDCC">
<p><a href="http://cvs-mirror.mozilla.org/webtools/tinderbox/showbuilds.cgi?tree=SeaMonkey&amp;hours=4&amp;nocrap=1">
Tinderbox</a> is your one-stop shop for build process information. Be aware that
the tree (the source code repository) is changing hourly, and you'll find people
checking in code day and night. You want to pull your source when the tree is good
and building (when it shows green). The columns to look at are "Mac Opt Clbr", and
"Mac Opt Depend". Here is what those mean:
<p>
<dl>
	<dt>Mac Opt Clbr
	<dd>The Macintosh Optimized, Clobber build. This builds the non-debug targets
	of all projects, and is 'clobber', which means that it pulls a fresh source
	tree for each build. This makes it slow.
	
	<dt>Mac Opt Dep
	<dd>The Macintosh Optimized, Depend build. This just pulls updates into an existing
	tree and rebuilds, which can be much faster.
</dl>
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Now, to start the build process, there are some things you have
to do only the first time:
<p>
<ol>
	<li><p>Check out the module <tt>mozilla/build/mac</tt>. 
	If you've followed the instructions above, you can 
	just select the menu <br><tt>Action | Check Out Default
	Module</tt>.
    <p>
	<li><p>Once CVS is done checking out the build directory,
	go to your local tree directory and open it.
	Drill down to the
	<tt>:mozilla:build:mac:</tt> folder, and
	you should see several build scripts waiting for you.
	<p>
	<p>You should also see the <tt>RunTSScript</tt>
	MPW compiler. You'll need to place a copy of this in your 
	CodeWarrior Pro 4 folder, in <tt>Metrowerks CodeWarrior:CodeWarrior
	Plugins:Compilers:</tt>. Quit and restart the IDE after doing this.
	<p>

	<li><p>Run <tt>PullNGlayout.pl</tt> to download
	to rest of the source. Just drag that file onto MacPerl, or
	run it in MacPerl whatever other way you prefer.
	
	<p>The first time you run <tt>PullNGlayout.pl</tt>, 
	it will prompt you for the location of your CVS session file. 
	This file will be used to check out the rest of the tree.

	<p>Run <tt>BuildNGLayoutDebug.pl</tt> from
	MacPerl.  This script will build all the projects and 
	create a Macintosh application directory in
	<tt>:mozilla:dist:viewer_debug:</tt> within your source tree.
	In that folder, you'll find a couple of applications:
	apprunner, which is what will become the final browser, and
	viwer, which is a small app that is used for testing the
	layout engine.
</ol>


<h3>Updating and Building Mac Mozilla on subsequent occasions</h3>

<p>Subsequent builds are a little easier.
<p>
<ol>
	<li><p>
	Before pulling the source code, always make sure the Macintosh build
	on <a href="http://cvs-mirror.mozilla.org/webtools/tinderbox/showbuilds.cgi?tree=SeaMonkey&amp;hours=4&amp;nocrap=1">
	tinderbox</a> is green.  Redness on tinderbox presages a pull that will not build.
	If the Macintosh build is showing red, You might as well go to a movie and try later.  
	<p>
	<li><p>Check out <tt>:mozilla:build:mac:</tt> again. This is because the scripts you
	use to pull and build the tree themselves reside in the tree. Therefore, if
	somebody has checked in changes to these scripts,
	you need to ensure that you are pulling and building with the latest version of the scripts.
	<p>
	<li><p>Run <tt>PullNGlayout.pl</tt> to update your local tree with changes
	from the Mozilla repository.
	<p>
	<li><p>Run <tt>BuildNGLayoutDebug.pl</tt> from MacPerl. 
	This script will build all the projects and create a Macintosh
	application directory in <tt>:mozilla:dist:viewer_debug:</tt>
	within your source tree.
	</ol>

<center><h3>More about the build system</h3></center>

<p>The build system uses MacPerl to drive various Mac applications
with AppleScript and AppleEvents. It
consists of 3 perl scripts:
<table border="1">
	<tr valign=top>
		<td align=right><p><tt>NGLayoutBuildList.pm</tt></td>
		<td>
	<p>Contains the list of directories to check out, 
	manifest files to be processed for inclusion in <tt>:mozilla:dist:</tt>, 
	and projects to built. It builds both debug and optimized versions. 
	Has 3 main functions: 
	<tt>Checkout</tt>, <tt>BuildDist</tt>, and <tt>BuildProjects</tt>. 
	When run for the first time, it will prompt you for the location 
	of the CVS session file, and store the location in 
	<tt>nglayout.cvsloc</tt> above your source tree.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr valign=top>
		<td align=right><p><tt>PullNGLayout.pl</tt></td>
		<td>

	<p>Pulls the source tree required to build NGLayout. 
		To use the script, double-click on it and it will start executing. 
		An open-file dialog box will come up. 
		Direct it to the MacCVS Session file that you used 
		to check out the script. Open the session, and the perl script 
		will then send a series of checkout commands to MacCVS 
		and pull the required sources.
		</td>

	</tr>
	<tr valign=top>
		<td align=right><p><tt>BuildNGLayoutDebug.pl</tt></td>
		<td>

	<p>Configures various build options and starts a build of NGLayout.
		<p>Mac build scripts have an annoying problem:
		there is no way to specify command-line options to MacPerl.
		This means that you can't specify different make options 
		to the build system without editing the scripts.
			
		<p>To customize your builds 
		(<tt>build_all</tt>, <tt>pull_layout</tt>, etc.),
		make a copy of the build script (<tt>BuildNGLayoutDebug.pl</tt>) 

			and name it whatever you like.
			Then edit the <tt>%pull</tt> and <tt>%build</tt> 
			variables inside the script. 
			To build optimized binary, set <tt>$DEBUG = 0</tt>.
		
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p><b>Hack alert</b>: 
To create
NGLayout-specific #defines that span all the projects, 
the build scripts use a hack. 
All Mac projects we care about include
<tt>mozilla/config/mac/MacConfigInclude.h</tt>.

<center><h3>FAQ about building Mozilla</h3></center>

<h5>Something in this document is wrong</h5>
<p>Please inform the 
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/owners.html">MacFE project owners</a> 
of the error, and (ideally) recommend a solution. 
Answers to additional problems not yet in the FAQ are also welcome.

<h5>Where else can I go for answers?</h5>
<p>Point your newsreader at the Mozilla newsgroups
or
subscribe to the mailing lists:
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/community.html">
	http://www.mozilla.org/community.html</a>.

<p>Also, check out 
    <a href="making-additions.html">
    So you want to add something
    (and not break the build) ...</a>, a guide to adding files and
    directories without breaking any of the three platforms.

<h5>Can I build with older versions of CodeWarrior?</h5>
<p>Currently, 
the answer is, "No." We make use of several classes in PowerPlant which 
recently appeared in Pro4. Time to upgrade, I'm afraid. Don't even try 
opening the projects with Pro2 because you will get data loss and have 
to throw the project away (it won't even prompt you!).

<h5>I can't build the stubs target of NSStdLib.mcp</h5>
<p>It sounds as though your 
ToolServer environment is not set up correctly. Make sure you follow 
the directions to the letter.  You could also be seeing this if you 
have multiple versions of ToolServer on your computer and the Finder 
lauches the wrong one.  This is very common, as the Carbon Dater app 
from Apple DTS contains a copy of ToolServer.  Either remove all the 
other versions of ToolServer or make sure you launch the appropriate 
version before you start building.

<p> Other thoughts: if ToolServer is not on your boot disk, you may 
have to launch it by hand before starting your build.  The symptom in 
this case will be a "freeze" in which CodeWarrior is waiting for the 
Finder to finish launching ToolServer.

<h5>MacPerl is giving me grief.</h5>
<p>If you're seeing AppleEvents 
errors, you probably need to give MacPerl more RAM to play with. If 
you're still using the default RAM size, increase it by 1MB.

<p>If MacPerl appears to be freezing, patience is the first approach - 
especially if you're on a slow Mac.

<p>If you're sure that MacPerl is frozen, maybe the build script can't 
find or launch CodeWarrior. The CodeWarriorLib.pm tries its best to 
find CodeWarrior without bothering you, but sometimes this doesn't 
work. Try opening the CodeWarrior IDE <b>before</b> you run whatever 
Perl script you're trying to run.

<p>Also, check that the addition perl modules you downloaded
in the install process have Macintosh line breaks. MacPerl dislikes
other linebreaks.

<h5>How can I stop a build in progress?</h5>
<p>The most reliable way 
is to quit the CW IDE. Just switch to CodeWarrior and press command-Q. 
CodeWarrior may ask you to confirm the action, and it may complete the 
current job before quitting. MacPerl should error out; sometimes, 
MacPerl will also relaunch CodeWarrior.

<h5>How much RAM does CodeWarrior need</h5>
<p>The IDE in CodeWarrior Pro 4 uses temprorary system memory as needed.
An ideal partition size for normal builds is 18-24Mb.

<h5>Why won't JavaScript build?</h5>

If you are doing an optimized build, it is likely that CodeWarrior is
running out of memory when compiling <tt>jsinterp.c</tt>.
This source file is written in such a way that the
CodeWarrior compiler's memory use when optimizing it goes
through the roof. If you're seeing this problem,
try modifying <tt>jsinterp.c</tt> by adding the line
<p><tt>#pragma optimization_level 2</tt>
<p>near the top of the file..
