<H2><A NAME="s9">9. Implementation strategy</A></H2>


<P>Roughly in the order of priority:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Implement -On options and with no optimizations turned on,
spill all registers to memory.
<LI> Implement the breakpoint routines, by handling the break point
related bytecodes and primitives appropriately.
<LI> Implement the thread status related API.
</UL>
<P></P>
<P>The goal is to get a very basic debugger which handles breakpoints
correctly and supports dumping local variables, all of which have been
spilled into memory working on all the platforms we're planning to
support.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss9.1">9.1 Propagation of Symbolic information</A></H2>


<P>During the construction of the primitive graph, the data nodes will be
annotated with a pointer to the <CODE>LocalVariableEntry</CODE>. Since it
is important to keep the compilation time down, it is necessary to
quickly get to a <CODE>LocalVariableEntry</CODE> at a given slot
index. Since the JVM specification doesn't state an order in which
these entries appear in the table, we'll keep the local variables in
the increasing order with respect to the slot index, so that a binary
search of the table will get us to the right entry in O(log(n)) time.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss9.2">9.2 What happens when a breakpoint is hit ?</A></H2>


<P>A hardware specific breakpoint/trap instruction will be inserted into
the native code. A platform specific trap handler gets executed and
the trap handler sends a JVMDI_Event of type
JVMDI_EVENT_BREAKPOINT. And then waits till the debugger tells it to 
continue execution using a user defined event.</P>

<H2><A NAME="lookup-local"></A> <A NAME="ss9.3">9.3 Finding the values of local variables at runtime</A></H2>


<P>An auxillary data structure <CODE>pc2bci</CODE> maps the current PC to a byte
code index. Each local variable entry in the <CODE>LocalVariableTable</CODE>
will be annotated with a list of mappings from byte code ranges to
it's address in register or memory.</P>
<P>So querying the value of a local variable will involve the following
steps: </P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Look up the byte code index in <CODE>pc2bci</CODE> using the current
PC. 
<LI> Look the <CODE>LocalVariableEntry</CODE> up in <CODE>LocalVariableTable</CODE>
by name.
<LI> Scan the list of mappings looking for the one that has the
required bytecode.
<LI> Use the type information and the address to fetch the value of
the local variable.
</UL>
<P></P>

<H2><A NAME="ss9.4">9.4 Flow of control</A></H2>


<P>The debugger will run as a separate NSPR thread and wait for events coming 
  in from the primitive debugger interface (PDI) as detailed in the <A HREF="debugger.html#Javasoft">Javasoft</A> 
  document.</P>

<P>Since all the necessary infrastructure is not in place, for testing
purposes, an external driver program will be used that sends socket based
messages to the debugger thread. </P>

<P>Further if the VM has been invoked with the <CODE>-debug</CODE> option, the VM
sends a breakpoint event to itself at the main routine, in order to
give the (possibly) remote debugger an opportunity to connect to the
VM. (Is this really necessary ?)</P>
