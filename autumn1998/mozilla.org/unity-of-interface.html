<BR>18-May-98
</P>

<P> If one must pick one thing as being the core concept and greatest
strength of the ``web browser'' as we know it today, it is this:

<P><TABLE WIDTH="100%" CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 BORDER=0>
 <TR>
  <TD WIDTH="15%"></TD>
  <TD WIDTH="70%">
   <TABLE CELLPADDING=10 CELLSPACING=0 BORDER=2><TR><TD>
    The same interface for the same task, regardless of how the service
    is implemented on the other end.
   </TD></TR></TABLE>
  </TD>
  <TD WIDTH="15%"></TD>
 </TR>
</TABLE>

<P> Short of being cross-platform (which deserves a document of its own) 
Mozilla's greatest strength is that it manages to provide a unified
interface to a number of useful services and protocols.

<P><B>It is more interesting to support a concept than to support a
      particular implementation of it.</B>
<UL>

<P> For example, document retrieval works the same way regardless of
the underlying protocols used, be they HTTP, FTP, Gopher...  The
important detail is the act of clicking on a link, and getting a
document back.  All else is implementation detail, and of no interest
to the end user.

<P> Likewise, the Mozilla mail reader behaves the same way regardless
of where the messages are stored (on the local disk, or on an IMAP
server.)  And the user interfaces for the Mozilla mail reader and news
reader are very similar because they are very similar tasks: management
and retrieval of messages.  They differ in certain specifics, but the
concepts are largely the same, and therefore, the interfaces are
largely the same.

<P> As support for new protocols is added to Mozilla in the future,
such support should follow this same model: when there are two
protocols that do similar things, Mozilla should support a common
interface for each.

</UL>
<P><B>How do you write software that supports a general concept?</B>
<UL>

<P> First by cataloging the various features of the specific protocols
that exist, and deciding what the most important overlapping concepts
are.  Then, you try and build an interface that does all the important
stuff the same way, and (hopefully) allows the protocol-<WBR>specific
features to show through when they are available.

<P> FTP, HTTP, and Gopher have disjoint sets of features, but Mozilla
supports each of these protocols.  It doesn't support them all
<I>fully</I>; there are a number of commands that a command-line ftp
client supports that aren't accessible from Mozilla; but the basics are
there.  And 99.5% of the time, it's good enough.

<P> Mail and News are another example of the same thing; there are some
very mail-<WBR>specific concepts, like deletion; some very news-<WBR>specific
concepts cancelling; and some concepts that are pretty-much the same if
you look at them right, like the various reply options, and
subscription, and <NOBR>kill files /</NOBR> filters.

<P> Note that the important detail here is not reuse of <I>code</I>,
but rather, reuse of <I>interface</I>: there's a good chance that there
won't be much code sharing between the implementation of various
protocols (HTTP and FTP share very little code, for example, since
their on-<WBR>the-<WBR>wire protocols are radically different) but that doesn't
mean that, in so far as they have <I>conceptual</I> similarities, they
shouldn't present themselves to the user in a similar way.

<P> Some people argue that when you try and make one program that does
many things, you often end up with a program that doesn't do any of
them perfectly.

<P> I reject that argument, because the goal is to let the user
accomplish what they want to accomplish: not to produce the perfect
implementation of a particular protocol.  The latter may be a means to
the former end, but that's all.

<P> And, I believe that a program that does many things to the 70th
percentile beats hands down a program that does one thing perfectly;
and also beats hands down a suite of programs that all do one thing
perfectly, but that each do so with totally different interfaces that
must be learned afresh for each task.

</UL>
<P><B>A specific example: chat.</B>
<UL>

<P> For the sake of argument, I propose that Mozilla should include a
``chat'' client.  And, following the thesis presented above, that
Mozilla should support various chat protocols in an abstract way.

<P> It seems clear that chat systems like IRC and ICQ (and the AOL chat
rooms, and, to some extent, certain MUDs/MOOs) are similar enough that
one could come up with an interface to each of them that makes sense
for each: they all incorporate line-<WBR>at-<WBR>a-<WBR>time
communication among (potentially) large numbers of people.  They each
have concepts of ``rooms'' and ``private messages'' and so forth.

<P> However, let's also consider a harder example: could we come up
with an interface that worked for both IRC/AOL-<WBR>style chat systems,
and also for a more different system, the Unix ``talk'' protocol?

<P> Let's imagine that we have a UI with the general form of: a big
text area in which the various typed comments of the participants
appear; a text-entry area at the bottom; and a toolbar.  Let's imagine
that some of the commands available are concepts that are not available
on all chat systems, like ``change channel'' or ``change handle'' or
``upload GIF.''  Well, if the current protocol doesn't support it, the
command would be disabled.  (Or perhaps the set of commands on the
toolbar would be slightly different, depending on the protocol being
used.)

<P> Current implentations of the Unix ``talk'' protocol are unbuffered,
one-<WBR>character-<WBR>at-<WBR>a-<WBR>time systems in which the
participants can see each other typing, including deletions, as they
happen.

<P> I <I>think</I> that most other chat systems are
line-<WBR>at-<WBR>a-<WBR>time, or otherwise pre-editable.  Assuming
that this is the case, this would suggest that that the right thing to
do, in the ``talk'' implementation, is to make it do pre-editing as
well: that is, when using the Mozilla chat client to speak the ``talk''
protocol, characters would not be sent until the user hit return; and
likewise, the text from the person on the other end would be presented
one line at a time (or when the other person stopped typing for a
second or two, or something along those lines.)

<P> This would mean that if one person was using the Mozilla chat
client, and another person was using the classic Unix ``talk'' command,
they would have rather different UI experiences than they would have if
they were both using the same client.  However, that is no different
than the case of two people exchanging email using radically different
mail readers: they each have their preferred interfaces, but
communicate via common protocols.

</UL>
<P><B>Conclusion: tools versus protocols.</B>
<UL>

<P> The important thing to keep in mind when trying stuff like this is that
at some level, ``chat'' is a <I>concept</I>, like ``document retrieval''
or ``message handling,'' and what you're trying to do is build a useful
<I>tool</I> on top of those protocols that can interoperate with other 
tools that also happen to speak those protocols.  

<P> You are <I>not</I> necessarily trying to clone the user interface of 
those other, pre-existing tools.
