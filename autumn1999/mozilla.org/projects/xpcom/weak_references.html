<H2>Why do I need this?</H2>
<P>
</P>

<H2>How do I use it?</H2>
<P>
  Here's a sample.  The new and interesting things are highlighted.
<!-- /P -->
<DIV class="source-code">
<PRE class="source-code">
<SPAN class="warning">#include "nsWeakPtr.h"</SPAN>

<SPAN class="comment">// ...</SPAN>

  <SPAN class="comment">// it's easy to get a weak reference...</SPAN>
<SPAN class="warning">nsWeakPtr</SPAN> weakPtr = getter_AddRefs( <SPAN class="warning">NS_GetWeakReference(</SPAN>aFooPtr<SPAN class="warning">)</SPAN> );

<SPAN class="comment">// ...</SPAN>

{   <SPAN class="comment">// ...but to use my weak reference, I'll need a (short lived) owning reference</SPAN>
  nsCOMPtr&lt;nsIFoo&gt; tempFooPtr = <SPAN class="warning">do_QueryReferent(</SPAN>weakPtr<SPAN class="warning">)</SPAN>;

<P>
	In a real world example, however, you are more likely to be holding a weak reference
		in a member variable.
	In the following example, an <SPAN class="source-code">nsObservable</SPAN> must keep some kind of a reference to
		each observer, in order to report events.
	The <SPAN class="source-code">nsObservable</SPAN> doesn't want to keep the observers alive just to prevent a dangling pointer,
		however.
	So, instead of holding an owning reference to an <SPAN class="source-code">nsIObserver</SPAN>, it holds a weak reference.
	The weak reference doesn't artificially extend the life of the observer, and yet, it can never dangle.
</P>
<P>
	The following assumes that any <SPAN class="source-code">nsIObserver</SPAN> that is passed in also implements <SPAN class="source-code">nsISupportsWeakReference</SPAN>.
	You can extrapolate from managing a single observer to managing a list of observers.
<!-- /P -->
<DIV class="source-code">

      <SPAN class="comment">// ...</SPAN>

	It's key to note that an <SPAN class="source-code">nsWeakPtr</SPAN> has exactly the same interface as an <SPAN class="source-code">nsCOMPtr</SPAN>.
	In fact, <SPAN class="source-code">nsWeakPtr</SPAN> is defined like this
<!-- /P -->
<DIV class="source-code">
<PRE class="source-code">
typedef nsCOMPtr&lt;nsIWeakReference&gt; nsWeakPtr;
</PRE>
</DIV>
<P>
	...
</P>

<!-- CODE>
class nsObservable
	{
		// ...
		private:
			list<nsWeakPtr> mObservers;
	};

// ...

nsresult
nsObservable::AddObserver( nsIObserver* aObserver )
	{
		nsWeakPtr weakP = getter_AddRefs( NS_GetWeakReference(aObserver) );
		mObservers.append(weakP);
		return NS_OK;
	}

nsresult
nsObservable::NotifyObservers( nsIMessage* aMessage )
	{
		list<nsWeakPtr>::iterator next = mObservers.first();
		for ( list<nsWeakPtr>::iterator p = next++; p != mObservers.last(); p = next++ )
			{
				nsCOMPtr<nsIObserver> observer = do_QueryReferent(*p);
				if ( observer )
					observer->NoticeMessage(aMessage);
				else
					mObservers.erase(p);
			}
	}

// ...

<H2>Well this sucks!</H2>
<P>
  By now you've probably noticed that this particular weak reference implementation doesn't give you
    exactly the interface you were hoping for.
</P>
<H3>Why can't I just directly call my interfaces methods on the weak reference?</H3>
<P>
  You really want this weak reference scheme to give you a pointer that implements the interface
    you actually care about, e.g.,
<!-- /P -->
<DIV class="source-code">
<PRE class="source-code">
<SPAN class="comment">// Note: _not_ the implementation we have...</SPAN>
nsWeakPtr&lt;nsIFoo&gt; weakFooPtr = fooPtr;
<SPAN class="comment">// ...</SPAN>
if ( weakFooPtr )
  status = weakFooPtr-&gt;SomeFooMethod(...);
</PRE>
</DIV>
<P>
  This is a reasonable thing to want.
  It's expensive to implement automatically, however.
  Neither inheritance, nor templates, nor macros can help automatically forward all the method calls
    to the real object.
  XPIDL could write an implementation for you (if we modified it), or you could write one by hand as I discuss below.
  There are other, mostly negligable, costs:
    it's an extra indirection per call, and
    the easy implementation requires adding an extra pointer per interface to the target implementation.
</P>

<H3>Why can't I just QueryInterface between the pair?</H3>
<P>
  It really feels like the <SPAN class="source-code">nsIWeakReference</SPAN> that you are holding is just another interface on the target object.
  It seems reasonable to want to simply <SPAN class="source-code">QueryInterface</SPAN> between the two.
  Why these extra calls: <SPAN class="source-code">GetWeakReference</SPAN> and <SPAN class="source-code">QueryReferent</SPAN>?
  This would be possible if the weak reference was actually aggregated to the target object.
</P>

<P>
  The problem here is <SPAN class="source-code">QueryInterface</SPAN>.
  <SPAN class="source-code">QueryInterface</SPAN> must satisfy many requirements to allow COM to work.
  Among these requirements is that
    every call to QueryInterface against the same (aggragate) object
    for the same interface must yield the same result,
    no matter what interface pointer you call it through, and no matter when you call it.
  This is impossible in our situation, since we explicitly rely on the the fact that
    part of the aggregate can be destroyed.
  Subsequent attempts to reach that part must return <SPAN class="source-code">NULL</SPAN>.
  Sometimes our <SPAN class="source-code">QueryInterface</SPAN> through the weak pointer would return a pointer to the `real' interface,
    and sometimes it would return <SPAN class="source-code">NULL</SPAN>.
  We just broke COM.
</P>

<P>
  It's clear, therefore, that the weak reference can't be aggregated to the target object.
  Hence, we can't use <SPAN class="source-code">QueryInterface</SPAN> to move between them.
  I know this sounds more convenient, but the global routine <SPAN class="source-code">NS_GetWeakReference</SPAN> makes it easy to
    go from the target object to the weak reference;
    and <SPAN class="source-code">nsIWeakReference::QueryReferent</SPAN> gives you the same functionality as <SPAN class="source-code">QueryInterface</SPAN> for
    getting back.
  Additionally, <SPAN class="source-code">nsCOMPtr</SPAN> now supports the new key <SPAN class="source-code">do_QueryReferent</SPAN> to simplify life even further.
</P>

<H2>How do I make a class support weak references?</H2>
<H3>The easy way</H3>
<P>
	Just roll in <SPAN class="source-code">nsSupportsWeakReference</SPAN>, a mix-in class that does all the work,
		and adjust your <SPAN class="source-code">QueryInterface</SPAN> accordingly, e.g.,
<!-- /P -->
<DIV class="source-code">
<PRE class="source-code">
<SPAN class="comment">//...</SPAN>
<SPAN class="warning">#include "nsWeakReference.h"</SPAN>

class nsFoo : public nsIFoo, ...<SPAN class="warning">, public nsSupportsWeakReference</SPAN> { ... };

<SPAN class="comment">// ...</SPAN>

NS_IMETHODIMP
nsFoo::QueryInterface( REFNSIID aIID, void** aInstancePtr )
  {
    <SPAN class="comment">// ...</SPAN>
    <SPAN class="warning">else if ( aIID.Equals(nsCOMTypeInfo&lt;nsISupportsWeakReference&gt;::GetIID()) )
      *aInstancePr = NS_STATIC_CAST(nsISupportsWeakReference* this);</SPAN>
    <SPAN class="comment">// ...</SPAN>
  }
</PRE>
</DIV>

<H3>The hard way</H3>
