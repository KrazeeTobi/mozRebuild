<h3><center>Roadmap for XPCOM, XPConnect, XPTCall, and XPIDL</center></h3>

<B>XPCOM</B> is a lightweight cross platform COM work-alike. It provides
interfaces, factories, reference counting, QueryInterface based 'casting', 
auto pointers, and various other useful stuff. It is the foundation for 
modularity in mozilla.

<B>XPConnect</B> is a service that facilitates calling between native code and 
JavaScript. It does this by dynamically building 'wrapper' objects to allow 
virtually transparent use of foreign objects(. It uses no generated code. For 
normal cases no restrictions are placed upon the participating objects except 
that their interfaces must have been declared in the XPIDL interface definition 
language and they must follow the rules and conventions of XPCOM.

<P>
<b>XPConnect features</B>
<UL>
<LI>Transparent calling accross language boundaries.
<LI>Automatic mapping between reference counting and garbage collection.
<LI>Typelib based - no generated code. Typelibs are cross platform.
<LI>Mapping between XPCOM out params and JS return values.
<LI>Automatic type conversions of params and result (with automatic wrapper creation as needed).
<LI>Support for specialized JavaScript behavior using nsIXPCScriptable.
<LI>Normal vtbl based interfaces usage - no IDispatch or dual interfaces.
<LI>Single declaration of interfaces in XPIDL for headers and typelibs.
<LI>Multiple interfaces per object support.
<LI>Reflection of XPCOM object repository into JavaScript.
<LI>Support for arbitrary JS properties on wrapped native xpcom objects.
</UL>

<B>XPTCall</B> is a library that supports both invoking methods on arbitrary 
xpcom objects and implementing classes whose objects can impersonate any 
xpcom interface. It does this using platform specific assembly language code.
XPTCall is required by XPConnect and must be ported to any platform on which 
XPConnect (and some other mozilla code which also uses XPTCall) will run.

<b>XPIDL</b> is yet another interface definition language. XPIDL is also the
name of  the compiler that compiles xpidl files. The syntax is based on CORBA.
Some extensions have been added. Many CORBA features are not supported. The
compiler generates C++ headers and typelibs. At some future point Javadoc-like
interface  documentation will also be produced by the tool.

<P>

There is a linker (xpt_link) to merge typelib files and a dump utility 
(xpt_dump) to display their contents in human readable form.

<P>

The compiler also has an '-m stubs' mode that produces JavaScript API (JSAPI) 
code. This is temporary hack that was implemented as an interim solution while
XPConnect was not yet ready for use. We are phasing out its use. Do not be 
confused - this generated code is not XPConnect.

<P>

<i>At this point in time we are busily working toward deploying XPIDL. The
current  docs are very much out of date. A URL with notes for new docs is among
those listed below.</i>
