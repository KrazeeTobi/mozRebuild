<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>binaries</H1>

<P>We make binary versions of of Mozilla available  <B>for testing purposes 
only!</B> They are not stable or complete enough for daily usage. We
put them here for you to try out and report the bugs you find. Its
guaranteed that you'll find bugs. Lots of them.

<P>It is <B>very important</B> that you understand that these binaries
are not complete programs. They might crash on
startup.  They might delete all your files and cause your computer to
burst into flames.
Our binaries also include time bombs: they will expire, and stop
working, 30 days after the date at which they were built.  This is because
we know that they are buggy, and we don't want people to continue to use
them for very long.  If you choose to run the nightly builds, you should
be prepared to upgrade them often.

<P>If you are running these binaries, we strongly encourage you to
participate in the various <A HREF="community.html">mailing lists and
newsgroups</A> hosted by mozilla.org.
And <B><I>please</I></B> report any <A HREF="bugs/"><B>bugs</B></A> you
find!  That, of course, is the whole reason we make these binaries
available.

<H2><A HREF="projects/seamonkey/">Milestone Builds</A></H2>
The Seamonkey project is the organized effort to ship the first 
commercial releases of the browser and e-mail and page composer 
clients from the mozilla source code baseline. The Seamonkey project is 
organized around several milestones. Each milestone 
adds additional infrastructure, features and bug fixes. The milestones 
are intended to be periodic check points for progress on the project, 
stability of builds, porting status, and are entry points for additional 
mozilla contributors to provide testing and engineering help on the project.
<P>
The milestone builds should be the least unstable of our builds.
If this is the first time you've tried mozilla, then get one of these.

<P>

<H2>Nightly Builds</H2>
These builds are the least stable, but the most up-to-date. If you do
a lot of bug reporting or want to check out a new feature 
that hasn't made its way into a milestone build yet, then try one of these.
New binaries are produced each week day. We only keep around seven days worth 
of binaries. If you download one and it doesn't work, then try the one from 
the day before, or the day after. Remember, this isn't a finished product.
These builds are here for developers and testers. Don't 
expect this to replace your present browser (yet).

These products are based on the mozilla source. Feel free to try them
out and give feedback to their publishers. While these programs contain
some of our code, the products themselves aren't ours, so
any bugs you find should be reported to their publishers and not to
Bugzilla.
