<h3>What are XPJS Components?</h3>

<blockquote>

XPJS Components is a (cheesy) name for a system to support xpcom components
written in JavaScript. Now, you might ask: "Isn't that what <a
href="index.html">XPConnect</a> does?" And
I would answer that XPConnect is necessary, but not sufficient to the task.
XPConnect provides the mechanisms for communication between native and JS xpcom
components, but it does not provide all of the infrastructure to register and
instantiate JS components outside of the limitations of the browser window.
XPJS will provide that infrastructure.

</blockquote>

<h3>So what does this mean?</h3>

<blockquote>

The XPJS Component system will support implementing xpcom services, factories,
and components in JavaScript. It will support service and factory registration.
These components will be independent of web content and browser windows. They
will run from the user's disk just like native components.

</blockquote>

<h3>How will it work?</h3>

<blockquote>

The overriding principle is to make this work as much like native components as
possible. XJS Components will 'live' in <i>.js</i> files. Just as with native
component modules each of these .js files will be expected to have the
functions:

<ul>

<li>NSRegisterSelf

<li>NSGetFactory

<li>NSUnregisterSelf (optional)

<li>NSCanUnload (optional)

</ul>

Each .js file might implement one or more components.

<p>

We will have one native module - called the XPJSManager - which holds this
system together. The XPJSManager is in charge of loading these .js files,
helping them register themselves, and acting as an intermediary between the
xpcom component manager and the JS code.

<p>

XJS Components are not run in browser windows. Each .js file (let's call it a
module) is started up and run in the context of a relatively 'raw' JS global
object. The standard (non-DOM) JS classes will be available. The xpconnect
<i>Components</i> object will be available. And some additional yet to be
defined objects may be available. The xpconnect <i>Components</i> object allows
access to the whole repository of native and JS xpcom components, so this is not
as isolated an environment as it might at first sound.

<p>

A 'load' or 'import' function will also be provided to let the JS code import
other .js files where libraries of code might be stored. This is akin to
'static' libraries. Accessing other components/services via xpcom/xpconnect is
more akin to 'dynamic' libraries.

<p>

When a XPJS Component module is first installed - or at autoregistration time -
the XPJSManager will load the .js file into a fresh JS environment, let its top
level script run to do whatever initialization it wants to do, and then it will
call the module's NSRegisterSelf function (passing the filespec of the .js
file). At this point the module will use the (new) methods on the Components
object to register itself with the component manager as a factory module for one
or more classid or progid. 

<p> 

This registration function that the JS code calls (e.g.
Components.RegisterComponentSpec) will be provided by the XPJSManager. The
XPJSManager will receive this call from the JS code, store the mapping of clsid
to .js filespec in the registry for its own use later, and then call the real
component manager to do the registration. However, the XPJSManager will pass the
component manager its *own* filespec.

<p>

So, at some future point some chunk of code will ask the component manager to
create an object instance for some clsid (or progid). The component manager will
load up the XPJSManager's module and call the native NSGetFactory it finds
there. That native NSGetFactory function will check the information it stored in
the registry to see that the JS factory for the given clsid is in a given .js
file. It will load that .js file (if not already loaded) and call the
NSGetFactory function.

<p>

Our friend XPConnect will convert the JS object returned from the JS module's
NSGetFactory function into an xpcom object. The component manager (and anyone
else with a reference to that factory) can then call the factory's
CreateInstance method at will.

<p>

The JS module is free to implement factories and components and services that
the factories construct on command. Any code anywhere and implemented in any
language can get to these things via the component and service managers.

<p>

The XPJSManager is loosely in charge of the lifetime of each XPJS module.
JavaScript is garbage collected and one can not force an object to be deleted or
the compiled code to be unloaded [except by deleting the JSRuntime; i.e. erasing
the entire JS universe]. In C++ if a module gets unloaded when there are still
references to objects created by the module then a crash is likely to happen
soon after. JS does not have this problem. If the XPJSManager is asked to trim
itself back (by whatever means) it will call the NSCanUnload method (if present)
on each module. It the module OKs it then the XPJSManager will release its root
of the module's global object and release any hold over the objects in the
module. Any subsequent requests from the component manager that would result in
NSGetFactory calls into the module will force the XPJSManager to load up a new
instance of the .js file and start over. So, these XPJS Component modules are
safely unloadable, but have the power (like native modules) to veto any attempt.

<p>

</blockquote>

<h3>So when will it be ready?</h3>

<blockquote>
I was thinking that I'd get on this pretty soon. I think that it is all very
straightforward. 

<p>

Comments and suggestions welcome!
