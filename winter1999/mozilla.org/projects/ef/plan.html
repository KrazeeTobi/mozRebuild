<P>In keeping with the philosophy of open source, ElectricalFire development
will proceed in the direction and manner chosen by those who contribute
to the project.&nbsp; So, consider the following document as a skeleton
- one possible future for ElectricalFire out of many.&nbsp; We'll put flesh
on these bones (or add new bones) as the project progresses.
<H2>Overall project organization</H2>

</UL>

<H2><a name="Developers"></a>Developers and Module Owners</H2>
<p>ElectricalFire is a big enough project that it needs to broken up into several 
  parts, each with a coordinator, or &quot;<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/owners.html">module 
  owner</a>&quot;, in mozilla-speak. Initially, some of the owners will come from 
  the original ElectricalFire development team, but that will likely change as 
  other developers come up to speed on the code.</p>
<p>A first cut at the partitioning might look like this:</p>
<table border="1" width="75%">
  <tr bgcolor="#e0f0ff"> 
    <th> 
      <div align="center">Module</div>
    </th>
    <th> 
      <div align="center">Owner</div>
    </th>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>Overall project administration</td>
    <td>Scott Furman</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>Intermediate code generation and optimization</td>
    <td>Waldemar Horwat</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>x86 back-end</td>
    <td>Bjorn Carlson</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>Java runtime libraries</td>
    <td><i>TBD</i></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>In addition, we'll need one module owner for each additional back-end targeting 
  a new architecture.</p>
<H2><a name="runtime"></a>Runtime Library</H2>
The lack of Java runtime libraries is the single largest hole in the ElectricalFire 
effort.&nbsp; EF provides partial implementations of the "core" Java libraries, 
i.e. java.lang, java.lang.reflect and java.io, but has no code for AWT or any 
of the other dozens of subsystems supported by Sun's JDK. The two most obvious 
suppliers for EF's runtime are the <a href="http://www.classpath.org/">GNU Classpath</a> 
effort and Sun's JDK 1.2 (under the new <a href="http://java.sun.com/features/1998/12/source_license_QA.html">community 
licensing policy</a>). To the extent possible, EF should support both, but the 
legal requirement to avoid tainting Classpath and ElectricalFire with Sun code 
may cause problems, e.g. if a developer looks at the Sun runtime library sources 
then they can't contribute to the Classpath effort. 
<H2><a name="Testing"></a>Compiler Tests</H2>


<P>More than most other types of programs, compiler code is notorious for having 
  insidious and subtle bugs. Even worse, it's difficult to quantify a compiler's 
  quality or that of a compiler test suite. For this reason, compiler suites tend 
  to be quite large so as to take advantage of any shotgun effect. Unfortunately, 
  there appears to be no way we can get free access to the tens of thousands of 
  test that make up Sun's JCK.
<P>However, EF can benefit tremendously from the library functional tests being 
  provided by the <a href="http://sourceware.cygnus.com/mauve/">Mauve project</a>, 
  and perhaps also from <a href="http://www.japhar.org">Japhar</a>'s tests. We'll 
  need to provide a small set of low-level regression tests that can be run quickly 
  so as to give developers confidence in checking in their changes. In particular, 
  we'll need some low-level bytecode instruction tests. Finally, it would be nice 
  to incorporate a few large Java applications into the test suite. 
<h2><a name="Testing"></a>Automated Testing</h2>
<p>Worse than introducing a regression is not discovering it until sometime after 
  it's introduced. When ElectricalFire was a commercial product, an automated 
  report was generated every day, which provided summary statistics and identified 
  test regressions. Assuming we can come up with the tests to run, it shouldn't 
  be too difficult to resurrect this machinery. Another type of automated testing 
  that we planned to do, but never got around to, was performance tracking, so 
  as to catch slowdowns in the compilation process or in compiled code.</p>
<H2><a name="Porting"></a>Porting</H2>
Only the x86 code generator is reasonably close to working order.&nbsp; The others 
(PowerPC, Sparc, PA-RISC, MIPS) are in various states of disrepair, as the original 
development tea, temporarily shed them to concentrate on the x86. At one point,&nbsp; 
<a href="mailto:Scott%20Silver%20%3Cscott.m.silver@alum.dartmouth.org%3E">Scott 
Silver</a> was working on a tool to make it easier to specify instruction selection 
rules. He would be a good person to contact when starting up a port to another 
architecture. 
<H2><A NAME="Exception_Support"></A>Exception Support</H2>

ElectricalFire's exception-handling code was nearly complete when the original
EF project was cancelled.&nbsp; Some of the remaining tasks:
<UL>
  <LI> Convert native C++ exceptions thrown by the compiler, e.g. IncompatibleClassChangeError, 
    into Java exceptions at the boundary between the compiled Java caller and 
    the native code callee. This is done in some places, but not all.
  <LI> Add support for x86 integer exceptions, e.g. divide-by-zero errors. 
  <LI> Fix the bytecode verifier's overzealousness.&nbsp; Right now, it does not 
    allow methods without an explicit return or throw as final bytecode, even 
    if that code is dead. This breaks some Java classes.
  <LI> Asyncronous exception handling needs to be addressed.&nbsp; (Or maybe not. 
    Isn't Thread.Stop() deprecated now ?) 
</UL>

<H2><A NAME="Register_Allocator"></A>Register Allocator</H2>

The existing register allocator, which is a variant on the classic coloring algorithm, 
suffers from unacceptably slow compilation performance for some methods. Unfortunately, 
the SSA intermediate form used in EF tends to produce lots of temporaries and 
this drives up the cost of register allocation. (The complexity of computing the 
register interference graph goes up as the square of the number of registers. 
<I>Editor: Is this right ?&nbsp; I seem to remember that our algorithm has an 
N<SUP>^4</SUP> component to it.</I>)&nbsp; In some extreme cases, compilation 
of a single very large function could take 20 minutes. We need an algorithm that 
is both more scalable and that makes better assignment/spilling decisions.&nbsp; 
A hierarchical allocator is needed, i.e. one that operates depth-first on the 
control-flow graph.&nbsp; Prior to the cancellation of the EF commercial project, 
a developer was working on a replacement allocator based on Proebsting et al's 
probability-based register allocation algorithm.&nbsp; Believe it or not, we seem 
to have lost the source code for the replacement allocator and we have not been 
successful at locating the developer.&nbsp; (<I>Anyone seen Laurent Morichetti 
?</I>) 
<H2><a name="GC"></a>Garbage Collection</H2>
ElectricalFire's <A HREF="techdocs/design/gc.html">garbage collector</A>, codenamed 
"Sport Model", is substantially complete, but it is not yet integrated with the 
rest of the compiler.&nbsp; Doing that integration is a massive task, since the 
GC must become intimately entwined with the compiler and runtime, e.g. by constraining 
the object layout and by requiring access to the stack and registers. Now might 
be a good time to review some of the Sport Model design decisions to see if a 
simpler initial implementation is possible.&nbsp; For example, the current design 
in which object headers are segregated onto their own memory pages might be an 
optimization for a future release.&nbsp; The conservative versus non-conservative 
GC question is another good way to start a fist-fight among the GC cognoscenti. 
<H2><a name="Optimizations"></a>Optimizing Code Generation</H2>
I'm not even going to attempt an exhaustive list of all the optimizations that 
might be implemented in EF.&nbsp; Even when source Java bytecodes are optimized 
prior to compilation, there are still many optimizations that can be done at the 
primitive graph or instruction level.&nbsp; Some obvious candidate optimizations 
would seek to lower the overhead that Java imposes (versus C++) by reducing/eliminating: 
<UL>
<LI>
null-reference checks

<LI>
array bounds checks

<LI>
checked narrowing of types
</UL>
Many of the traditional optimizations are also useful:
<UL>
  <LI> invariant loop hoisting and other types of code motion 
  <LI>
common subexpression (CSE) elimination

<LI>
better <A HREF="#Register_Allocator">register allocation</A>

<LI>
instruction scheduling
</UL>
When inlining is added to the compiler's arsenal, most of the traditional compiler 
optimizations also become important. 
<P>Waldemar <A HREF="techdocs/design/optimizations.html">wrote</A> some more about 
  optimizations a long time ago.
