<!-- created by jwz, 3-feb-98 -->


<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>getting involved</H1>

<P> As explained <A HREF="mission.html">earlier</A>, those of us here at
<B>mozilla.org</B> are not the primary coders of the Mozilla web browser.  We
function as a switchboard, facilitating the cooperation of the thousands of
participants out on the net.  And we assemble the fruit of that labor in one
place.

<P>
The real work gets done by people like you.

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Contributors</B><HR WIDTH="20%">

<P> How can you participate?  Simply by doing so!  We believe in ``deeds, not
words.''  We operate as a meritocracy, so the more good code you contribute,
the more you will be allowed to contribute: that is, the better a developer
you prove yourself to be through your actions, the more responsibility you
will be given.  This is not a ``Consortium.''  There is no such thing as
membership.  If you contribute code, then you're a member.  It's as simple as
that.

<P> Now, in our role as integrators of the work being done by the countless
others out on the net, we do have to have some rules.  If we just blindly
accept any patch thrown at us, pretty soon we'll have total chaos, and a
source tree that doesn't work, and that's no good for anybody.

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Module Owners</B><HR WIDTH="20%">

<P> The basic model we intend to operate under is that each major module will
have a designated owner.  That person will be the person who knows the code
best, and who feels that they are up to the task of being the arbiter of what
should go in to that module, and what shouldn't.  Chances are, this person
will also be the primary coder.  The module owner accepts improvements and
bug fixes from others on the net.

<P> One role of <B>mozilla.org</B> is to publicize the lists of module
owners, so that others who wish to coordinate with them can more easily do
so.  Another of <B>mozilla.org</B>'s functions is to direct incoming patches
or bug reports to the right module owner, in the case where the submitter of
the patch or report didn't know who the responsible party was.

<P> Changes to a module are made by that module's owner, and then sent to
<B>mozilla.org</B> for inclusion in our source distributions.  If the owner
of a module is new to the job, then we're probably going to work pretty
closely with them to make sure that we're actually helping each other out:
that they're giving us what we need to meet our desired level of quality, and
that we're giving them the information and assistance they need.  There are
no hard and fast rules here, but one thing that is definitely true is that
module owners will come to be judged, both by us and by the public, based on
what they've accomplished.

<P>The current list of module owners can be found
 <A HREF="owners.html">here</A>.

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Benevolent Dictator</B><HR WIDTH="20%">

<P> In this way, it's a self-regulating system: if a module owner is viewed
by the public as not doing a good job (perhaps their releases tend to be
buggy, or non-portable; or perhaps they aren't responsive to bug fixes or
suggestions) then what will happen is, someone out on the net will say to
themselves (and to us), ``<I>hey, I can do a better job than that.</I>''  
And we will say to them, ``<I>go right ahead.</I>''  

<P> If the usurper and the old module owner can't work out their differences,
then by default, the final decision becomes that of us here at
<B>mozilla.org</B>: we will be in a situation where there are two people
asking us to take their version of some particular module, and we're going to
pick the better one to include in our source releases.

<P> Now, hopefully it will almost never come to that.  In most cases, we
won't have to make those kinds of hard decisions, because people will tend to
work it out themselves, and cooperate, and accept help when it is offered.
There exists years of evidence in the open-source software community that 
such things tend to work themselves out without a big fuss.

<P> But, we here at <B>mozilla.org</B> decide what we put in the source
distributions that we make.  So that gives us final say on what goes
into <I>our</I> distributions.

<P> Of course, anyone anywhere in the world can make their own source
distributions: we aren't unique in that respect.  And that's another way
that the system is self-regulating: if the public believes that we are
making bad decisions about what to include and what not to include, about
whose work to use and whose not to, or anything of that nature, then the
public will vote with their collective feet: they will get their source
distributions from someone other than <B>mozilla.org</B>, and we will have
become irrelevant.

<P> This is the way nearly all successful open-source software projects work,
and that's why we're emulating it.  We call this the ``Benevolent Dictator'' 
model.  ``Dictator'' because there is one person (or organization) who
eventually gets final say in the case of disputes; and ``Benevolent'' 
because the dictator always tries to do the right thing.  Because if the
dictator stops doing the right thing, the dictator becomes ignored, and
ceases to be a dictator at all.

<P> For those more democratically-minded, another way of looking at it is
that the final arbiter really is something of an elected official: the voting
process consists of whether anyone listens to them.  

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>What Now?</B><HR WIDTH="20%">

<P> So you want to help?  Great!

<P> First, you need to pick a <A HREF="blue-sky/">project</A> (though
you've probably already got some ideas, right?), and familiarize yourself
with the <A HREF="docs/">code</A>.  

<P> Please read the rest of the introductory documents on this web site,
especially the <A HREF="mission.html">mission</A> and 
<A HREF="advocacy.html">advocacy</A> documents.  After that, it would be a
really good idea for you to join the appropriate 
<A HREF="community.html">mailing lists</A>, and get a feel for how the 
community works together.

<P> Before you actually start coding up a project, we'd strongly recommend
that you <A HREF="feedback.html">let us know</A> about it.  If you like, we
can publicize the fact that you're working on it, and perhaps someone else 
will want to work with you on it.  If you don't want it publicized, that's 
fine too, but it would help us here at <B>mozilla.org</B> to know how many 
different people are tackling the same kinds of projects.

<P>
