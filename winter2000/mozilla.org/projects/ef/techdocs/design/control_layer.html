<P>In its simplest form, the primitive graph is composed of <EM>control
nodes</EM> linked by control edges. Each control node can contain a number
of <A HREF="data_layer.html#df_node">data nodes</A> (<A HREF="primitives.html">primitives</A>
or <A HREF="data_layer.html#df_phi">phi-nodes</A>) to specify actual program
operations. An example of the control layer of the primitive graph is listed
on the <A HREF="example1.html">graph example page</A>.</P>

<P></P>

<H3>Semantics</H3>


<P>We can (conceptually) evaluate a function represented as a primitive
graph by starting at the begin node, following its control flow edge, and
evaluating the primitives and phi nodes inside each control node we encounter.
When we get to a control node with multiple exits, the node specifies which
one to take via a conditional or exception-throwing expression. We stop
when we reach the end node.</P>

<P>Each control node contains zero or more <A HREF="data_layer.html#df_node">data
nodes</A> that are evaluated together (subject to internal dependencies
such as one primitive using the results from another). When evaluation enters
the control node, it is always safe to evaluate all data nodes within it.
Evaluation may not enter a control node part way into it. Conditionals and
exceptions are represented by multiple edges leaving a control node. Merges
of control flow are represented by multiple edges entering a control node.</P>

<P>At this point we don't support subroutines as part of the control graph.
Instead, the primitive graph generator either expands <CODE>JSR</CODE> and
<CODE>RET</CODE> bytecodes into inline code or converts subroutines into
functions.</P>

<H3>Asynchronous Exceptions</H3>


<P>Asynchronous exceptions must be handled within a bounded amount of time
of being raised. To achieve this, we allow asynchronous exceptions to interrupt
execution either:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>On a function call or return
  <LI>On finishing execution of an aexc node
</UL>

<P>To make sure that the amount of time to reach one of the above three
points is bounded, the translator inserts an <STRONG>aexc</STRONG> node
into every cycle in the control flow graph.</P>

<P>The translator assumes that asynchronous exceptions may not occur at
any other point, such as inside basic blocks. Without this assumption it
would be impossible to do most code transformations because they would subtly
alter the Java semantics of asynchronous exceptions.</P>

<P>We prepend an <STRONG>aexc</STRONG> node A containing a check for asynchronous
exceptions to each node H that has at least one incoming back edge. This
bounds the amount of execution that can take place between checks for asynchronous
exceptions. As a side benefit, this transformation also makes the <STRONG>end</STRONG>
node reachable from every cycle, which helps satisfy constraint 6 above
for infinite loops. For simplicity we retarget all forward edges pointing
to node H to point to node A instead.</P>

<H3>Exception Edges and Cycles</H3>


<P>If an exception handler is allowed to handle exceptions arising in itself,
we may encounter a situation in which a <STRONG>catch</STRONG> node is the
head of a cycle in the control flow graph. Such a graph would violate our
<A HREF="#CYCLES1">CYCLES1</A> constraint, so in such a situation we <A
HREF="control_edges.html#exception_transformation">transform</A> the catch
node into several catch nodes.<HR ALIGN=LEFT><P></P>
