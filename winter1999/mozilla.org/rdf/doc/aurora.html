<h3>What is NavCenter (aka Aurora)?</h3>

NavCenter is a UI widget in Mozilla. It also represents an
attitude about information  management, desktop web integration,
and other things that Netscape engineers tend to discuss over beer.
<p>
You can read what our product marketing folks have to say about it 
<a href="http://home.netscape.com/comprod/products/communicator/future/aurora.html">here</a>.

<h4>The Simple Story</h4>
NavCenter is a simple tree-column widget (actually, the same widget
that is used in Messenger) that uses the 
<a href="hypertree.html">HT API</a> to acquire and display data.

<h4>The Other Story</h4>
The desktop of the future will be the Information Management
Shell --- the central place for dealing with information.
<P>

If you look around your desktop, there are many 
sets of "information organization structures" (IOS) ---
collections of taxonomies or webs of information.
Examples include:

<OL>
<LI> Local hard drive file directory structures.
<LI> Site Maps or table of contents of web sites.
<LI> Taxonomies such as Yahoo!
<LI> Search Indices
<LI> Bookmarks
<LI> FTP
<LI> History
<LI> Mailbox hierarchies
</OL>


Each of these lives an independent life. They each
have their own storage, own viewers and editors ...
<P>
There is clearly a lot of wasted effort. It is actually
much worse than just wasted effort. Its organization
of information based on the protocol used to access it,
not based on what its about or where the user wants to
put it. This balkanization
is at the root of many of our information 
problems.
<P>
NavCenter is an attempt at solving some of these problems.
In particular, it provides a way of navigating all of
the above sources of data. Furthermore it allows you
to integrate all of them. E.g., you can create
a workspace called Sailing under which you have
some local file system folders, portions of Yahoo!, Excite,
some live search queries, ... So, its a lot more than simply
slapping a common UI over multiple distinct sources of data.
<P>
NavCenter also makes it very easy to manifest new data sources
into NavCenter without any changes to the FE code. The FE widget
only talks RDF. Everything, right from the structure
of the tree, the columns that should be presented, the menu
commands for each item, ... comes from the RDF graph. 
We hope to make all aspects of NavCenter both scriptable and
declaratively specifiable. 
<P>
Please do not judge NavCenter by
what it is today. It is very much work in progress. We hope
you will help us make it better.
