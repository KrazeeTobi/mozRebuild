<h1>performance: overview</h1>

Last Updated: 12-October-1998

<p>
The goal of the Mozilla Performance Project is to improve the overall
performance of the Mozilla browser, especially for users that are
connected to the Internet via a slow, high-latency connection like a
28.8kbps modem. Most people (present company included!) currently
find that surfing the Internet can be a painfully slow experience. In
fact, in at least one survey, poor performance over dialup has been
cited as the <i>number one complaint</i> that people have with the
web!

<p>
Although there is <i>definitely</i> a positive correlation between
connection speed and browser performance, the modem isn't the only
contributor to the overall perception of slowness. Sure, your modem
brings low bandwidth and high latency to the party, but that's only
part of the puzzle. As much as we hate to admit it, there are plenty
of places where a pile of inefficient code is lurking deep in the
bowels of the browser. Furthermore, there may be many cases where the
browser could make a slow operation "seem" faster by providing more
feedback or a better user interface. This leads to the three areas
that we're hoping to focus on for Mozilla:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<i>Raw network performance</i>, which involves tweaking protocols to
get the most out of the modem (or any network connection, for that
matter). This will involve groveling through TCP traces to optimize
Mozilla's usage of the protocol, tuning OS-specific parameters to
identify the optimal setting for Mozilla, analyzing the potential
impact of HTTP/1.1 features, and so on. A secondary (but equally
important) task will be to ensure that the browser maintains a small
"network footprint", and doesn't use more that its fair share of
server and network resources.
</li>

<p>
<li>
<i>Raw program performance</i>, which involves detailed profiling to
find and remove "hotspots" in the code. A good entry point here will
be "that site that just always comes up too slowly", whether you're at
home on a modem or at work through a T1. This work will involve
getting down and dirty with some profiling tools, suggesting
algorithms (and of course, hacking up their implementation) to get
stuff running as fast as possible.
</li>
</p>

<p>
<li>
<i>Perceived program performance</i>, which is the catch-all for any
trick, hack, or gizmo that makes Mozilla seem faster. This could be
something as simple as improving the feedback that Mozilla gives to
the user during a slow network operation, or something as fancy as
hacking the order in which images get fetched and displayed. Unlike
network throughput and profiling, this is very qualitative, "touchy
feely" kind of area with a lot of potential for creativity.
</li>
</p>

</ol>

<p>
<b><i>How can I get involved?</i></b> Simple. Pick something that's
slow and make it run fast <i>fast <b>fast</b></i>! For starters, take a look at some
of the

<a href="projects.html">project ideas</a>

that we've come up with internally. For the projects that are
underway, pick apart our algorithms and methodology, and tell us how
we could be doing things better. Or

<a href="mailto:waterson@netscape.com">suggest</a>

your own performance project: I'll add it to the
growing list of

<a href="ideas.html">uncooked ideas</a>

that people have sent in. If you'd like to get involved with
mozilla.org, working on Mozilla's performance is a great way to start:
most of the projects can start small, and it's easy to measure the
impact of your individual contributions.
</p>

<p>
<b><i>How does this relate to the

<a href="../newlayout/">new layout engine</a>?</i></b>

The new layout engine, sometimes referred to as <i>NGLayout</i>, is a
ground-up rewrite of the layout code, and it incorporates a ton of
fancy algorithms to make presentation faster. Unfortunately, NGLayout
isn't going to be integrated into Mozilla for a while: the first
"official" release of Mozilla will probably go out with the current
layout engine. Although there definitely is some overlap in the
<i>layout</i> work that we're doing to improve the initial release of
Mozilla (e.g., continuous reflow and some of the caching
enhancements), we hope that much of the other work will flow naturally
into performance benefits for NGLayout.
