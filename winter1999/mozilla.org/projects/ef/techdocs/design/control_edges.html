<P>Control flow edges chart possible paths of execution through a set of
control nodes. Let us now take a look at several useful graph-theoretical
definitions as well as the procedure for designating which control flow
edges are forward edges and which are backward edges.</P>

<H2>Graph Theory Definitions</H2>


<H3><A NAME="cycle"></A>Cycles</H3>


<P>A <STRONG>cycle</STRONG> is any control flow path A -&gt; N<FONT SIZE=-2>1</FONT>
-&gt; N<FONT SIZE=-2>2</FONT> -&gt; ... -&gt; N<VAR><FONT SIZE=-2>n</FONT></VAR><FONT
 SIZE=-2>-1</FONT> -&gt; A that starts and ends at the same control node
and contains at least one edge. A cycle is not necessarily a <A HREF="#loop">loop</A>;
we use the term <I>loop</I> in a more specialized way.</P>

<H3><A NAME="reachable"></A>Reachability</H3>


<P>A control node B is <STRONG>reachable</STRONG> from control node A iff
there exists some control flow path A -&gt; N<FONT SIZE=-2>1</FONT> -&gt;
N<FONT SIZE=-2>2</FONT> -&gt; ... -&gt; N<VAR><FONT SIZE=-2>n</FONT></VAR><FONT
 SIZE=-2>-1</FONT> -&gt; B. In particular, every node is reachable from
itself.</P>

<H3><A NAME="dominator"></A><A NAME="postdominator"></A>Dominators and Postdominators</H3>


<P>A control node A <STRONG>dominates</STRONG> control node B iff every
control flow path from <VAR>begin</VAR> to B contains A. In particular,
every node dominates itself.</P>

<P>A control node A <STRONG>postdominates</STRONG> control node B iff every
control flow path from B to <VAR>end</VAR> contains A. In particular, every
node postdominates itself. Note that, by this definition, if there is no
path from B to <VAR>end</VAR> then every node postdominates B.</P>

<P>Dominators and postdominators can be computed easily using the general
dataflow algorithm; see page 671 of <A HREF="../bibliography.html#ASU86">[ASU86]</A>.</P>

<H2><A NAME="dfs"></A>Depth-First Search</H2>


<P>To proceed further we compute a <STRONG>depth-first spanning tree</STRONG>
of the control graph by following the algorithm on page 662 of <A HREF=
"../bibliography.html#ASU86">[ASU86]</A> on <I>all</I> edges of the control
graph. This algorithm yields the node numbers visible in the control layer
nodes.</P>

<H3>Forward and Backward Edges</H3>


<P>Ignoring exception and return edges for the moment, we define a <A NAME=
"edge_fwd"></A><STRONG>forward edge</STRONG> to be any control flow edge
whose source node has a number less than the destination node; all remaining
control flow edges are <A NAME="edge_back"></A><STRONG>backward edges</STRONG>.
Backward edges are what <A HREF="../bibliography.html#ASU86">[ASU86]</A>
calls <EM>retreating edges</EM>; forward edges are what <A HREF="../bibliography.html#ASU86">[ASU86]</A>
calls <EM>advancing edges</EM> and <EM>cross edges</EM>. We can make several
useful observations:</P>

<P><EM>A control graph with only forward edges is connected and acyclic.</EM>
This graph is connected because every edge in the depth-first spanning tree
is a forward edge. It is acyclic because every cycle N<FONT SIZE=-2>0</FONT>
-&gt; N<FONT SIZE=-2>1</FONT> -&gt; N<FONT SIZE=-2>2</FONT> -&gt; ... -&gt;
N<VAR><FONT SIZE=-2>n</FONT></VAR><FONT SIZE=-2>-1</FONT> -&gt; N<FONT SIZE=-2>0</FONT>
must include some <VAR>k</VAR> such that N<VAR><FONT SIZE=-2>k</FONT></VAR>
&gt;= N<VAR><FONT SIZE=-2>k</FONT></VAR><FONT SIZE=-2>+1</FONT>. As an immediate
corollary:</P>

<P><EM>Every <A HREF="#cycle">cycle</A> in the control graph includes a
backward edge</EM>.</P>

<P>We call a backward edge whose target dominates its source a <A NAME=
"edge_back_regular"></A><STRONG>regular backward edge</STRONG> (called a
<I>back edge</I> in <A HREF="../bibliography.html#ASU86">[ASU86]</A>). All
other backward edges are <A NAME="edge_back_irregular"></A><STRONG>irregular
backward edges</STRONG>. Note that, by the construction of the depth-first
spanning tree, a forward edge's target cannot dominate its source, so every
edge whose target dominates its source is a regular backward edge. Thus,
<EM>the set of regular backward edges can be defined without making use
of the depth-first search and is therefore independent of the choices we
make in the depth-first search</EM>.</P>

<P><EM>If a control graph is <A HREF="#reducible">reducible</A>, it contains
only regular backward edges</EM> (see page 663 of <A HREF="../bibliography.html#ASU86">[ASU86]</A>).
If the control graph is <A HREF="#irreducible">irreducible</A>, it will
include at least one irregular backward edge. The set of irregular backward
edges will vary depending on how we choose to traverse the control graph
in the depth-first search -- see the three possible traversals in Figure
1 which result in different designations of forward edges (dark red) and
backward edges (light red). To avoid inconsistencies we will choose one
depth-first traversal and use it consistently throughout the translator's
phases.</P>

<H3>Exception Edges</H3>


<P>Let us now consider exception edges. We would like all exception edges
to behave like forward edges so that constraint <A HREF="control_layer.html#CYCLES1">CYCLES1</A>
holds; in other words, for each exception edge, we'd like its source's number
to be less than its destination's number. If the graph satisfies this property
(in practice most will), we're done.</P>

<P><A NAME="exception_transformation"></A>For some graphs, such as the one
in <A HREF="#figure2">Figure 2a</A>, no matter how we conduct our depth-first
search we will obtain an exception edge whose source's number is not less
than its destination's number. If this happens, we modify the graph by splitting
the catch node that is the target of each such exception edge, as shown
in <A HREF="#figure2">Figure 2b</A>, where the catch node C has been split
into two catch nodes C1 and C2 followed by an aexc node C3, which is now
the loop header.</P>

<P>The graph has been transformed so that the only backward edge is the
edge from C2 to C3. If a catch node such as C2 has only one incoming edge,
then its depth-first number must necessarily be greater than its predecessor's
number, so its incoming exception edge behaves like a forward edge. Note
that in this example the exception edges pointing to catch node C1 already
behaved like forward edges, so it was not necessary to split node C1 further.</P>

<P>The aexc node C3 must have at least one outgoing exception edge for handling
asynchronous exceptions. We create such edges (shown exiting from the right
side of node C3) as appropriate.</P>

<P>An end node can also be a target of an exception edge. Fortunately we
never have to split the end node because the end node has no successors,
so every edge pointing to the end node behaves like a forward edge.</P>

<H3>Return Edges</H3>


<P>The <A HREF="control_layer.html#cf_edge_return">return edge</A> always
has the end node as its target and the end node has no successors, so the
return edge always behaves like a forward edge.</P>

<H3><A NAME="reducible"></A><A NAME="irreducible"></A>Reducible and Irreducible
Graphs</H3>


<P>A control graph is considered to be <STRONG>reducible</STRONG> if it
follows certain structured programming coventions. The following are all
equivalent definitions of a reducible control graph:</P>

<UL>
  <LI><IMG SRC="graphics/irreducible_subgraph.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH="131"
  HEIGHT="95" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">Each cycle in the graph has a single entry
  point.
  <LI>We can partition the graph's edges into forward and backward edges
  such that the set of forward edges is connected and acyclic and the target
  of each backward edge <A HREF="#dominator">dominates</A> its source.
  <LI>Reducing the graph by interval analysis (page 666 of <A HREF="../bibliography.html#ASU86">[ASU86]</A>)
  reduces it to a single node.
  <LI>The control graph has no subgraph of the form diagrammed on the right.
  (The paths are disjoint except at the nodes indicated.)
</UL>

<P>Any control graph that is not reducible is called <STRONG>irreducible</STRONG>.
All unoptimized Java source programs yield reducible graphs, although some
compiler optimizations might generate irreducible control graphs by the
time the Java source is converted to bytecodes.</P>

<H3><A NAME="loop"></A>Loops</H3>


<P>Given any regular backward edge E with source A and target H, we define
the <STRONG>natural loop</STRONG> of E to be the union of {H} with the set
of all control nodes N for which there exists a path from N to A that does
not include H (see page 604 of <A HREF="../bibliography.html#ASU86">[ASU86]</A>).
We will refer to node H as the natural loop's <STRONG>header</STRONG>.</P>

<P>Given any node H that is the target of at least one backward edge, we
define the <STRONG>loop</STRONG> headed by H to be the union of all natural
loops whose headers are H.</P>

<P>Note that not every <A HREF="#cycle">cycle</A> is a loop. For example,
the graph in <A HREF="#figure1">Figure 1</A> above does not contain any
loops because it has no regular backward edges.</P>

<P><A NAME="loop_tree"></A>Loops have the nice property that two loops in
a graph are either disjoint or one is entirely contained within the other
(see page 605 of <A HREF="../bibliography.html#ASU86">[ASU86]</A>). Hence,
we can classify all loops in a graph into a tree whose leaves are the innermost
loops, parents represent loops that contain the loops represented by their
children, and whose root represents the entire graph.</P>

<H2>Example</H2>


<P>Consider the control graph in <A HREF="#figure3">Figure 3</A>. This graph
is <A HREF="#irreducible">irreducible</A> because it contains two entry
points (15 and 21) into the cycle 15-&gt;16-&gt;17-&gt;20-&gt;21-&gt;15
and two entry points (23 and 26) into the cycle 23-&gt;26-&gt;27-&gt;28-&gt;23.
The depth-first search arbitrarily decided to make control edges 21-&gt;15
and 28-&gt;23 into irregular backward edges (it could have instead made
edge 13-&gt;15 into an irregular backward edge had it traversed the nodes
in a different order; it could also have tried to make edge 23-&gt;26 into
an irregular backward edge, which would have required node 26 to be <A 
HREF="#exception_transformation">split</A> into two catch nodes and another
aexc node).</P>

<P>This graph contains eight loops, each of which is shaded with a different
color in <A HREF="#figure4">Figure 4</A>. The headers of all of the loops
are highlighted. Figure 4 also shows the hierarchy of the loops as a tree.
By convention the root of that tree is always the <A HREF="control_layer.html#cf_begin">begin
node</A>, even though that node is never the header of a loop.</P>

<P>Highlights:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Loop 4 contains nodes {4, 5, 6, 7}. There is no separate inner loop
  which just contains nodes {4, 5} because all natural loops with the same
  header are considered to be one loop.
  <LI>An aexc node might have an incoming control edge from itself. Node
  25 is an example of this.
  <LI>Every loop must have an aexc node as its header, but not every aexc
  node is the header of a loop. For example, aexc node 15 is not the header
  of any loop because its incoming backward edge 21-&gt;15 is irregular.
  Node 23 has both an incoming regular backward edge 24-&gt;23 and an incoming
  irregular backward edge 28-&gt;23; this node is the header of the loop
  {23, 24} induced by the regular backward edge.
  <LI>A control edge is not uniquely specified by its source and target.
  For example, there are two control edges from node 11 to node 18.
