<BR><B>by Tague Griffith &lt;<A HREF="mailto: tague@netscape.com">tague@netscape.com</A>></B>
<BR><B>Last Modified:&nbsp;</B><SCRIPT>document.write(document.lastModified);</SCRIPT>
</CENTER>

<H3>1.0 Summary</H3>


<BLOCKQUOTE>This document details both the <B>locale model</B> and the
<B>locale functions</B> that will be implemented for the mozilla.org. A
<B>locale model</B> is a strategy and a set of usage requirements for handling
language and location preferences, while <B>locale functions </B>are a
set of APIs provided to programmers to manipulate objects representing
Locale preferences.&nbsp; The goal of the locale model is to enable developers
to correctly handle the expectations of users as they view web pages in
many different languages, which may even be different from the languages
installed on their computer.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>2.0 Potential User Scenarios</H3>


<BLOCKQUOTE>The following sections detail potential user scenarios and
how differences in locale and language between the users machine and the
content on the web should interact. This is not an exhaustive list, this
doesn't illustrate all of the ways a user might want a browser&nbsp; to
behave with regards to locale preferences, but it does try to capture
the most important usage scenarios.&nbsp; The purpose of this list is to
highlight the expectation of a user in pa

<P>Since this list is not exhaustive, please contribute additional usage
scenarios that illustrate user expectations that need to be supported by
Mozilla..
<H4>2.1 Just Japanese</H4>


<BLOCKQUOTE>The simplest user scenario is a user using a single language,
the user is looking at web pages in their native language, on a localized
version of communicator with a matching localized version of the operating
system.&nbsp; Although, this scenario covers the majority of users, we
feel that it is important to point out that browsing in English in addition
to a user's native language is also extremely common (common enough to
be a high priority item).&nbsp; In this case, we have a Japanese user with
a Japanese localized version of Mozilla running on a Japanese version of
the operating system, only browsing Japanese content from Japan. This user
wants all of his menus and page content in Japanese, following Japanese
locale conventions.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H4>2.2 French Railways International</H4>


<BLOCKQUOTE>An American user running an English localized version of Mozilla
is viewing a French web page that is running Javascript. This particular
page is from the French Ministry of Public Transportation and provides
internet sales of French rail passes. The Javascript on this page does
date and currency formatting. The user is planning a trip to France and
wants to purchase a rail pass. The user can speak a bit of functional French,
but is by no means fluent. Naturally, the user would prefer that all of
the browser chrome remain in English, but since French Railways only provides
a French version of their page, the user has no choice but to view the
content in French. Since the page in particular is dealing with both the
French language and purchases in France, the correct Locale choice for
the entire page including the Javascript is French.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H4>2.3 Chinese Stock Trading Page</H4>


<BLOCKQUOTE>A Chinese speaking user living in the Bay Area is accessing
a stock brokerage homepage. The stock brokerage recognizing the potential
market for non-English speaking customers, has provided several different
translations of their trading page. This page uses Javascript to calculate
both dates and do some currency formatting. Since the user is a native
Chinese speaker, they would prefer to work in Chinese as much as possible.
Their version of Mozilla&nbsp; is localized for Chinese.

<P>In this scenario, it the appropriate behavior for Navigator is to keep
the chrome in Chinese, but all the content, including the Javascript should
be Chinese with one exception - the monetary formatting. Because this page
is for a US company, all of the transactions are in US dollars. The Javascript
should continue to format the dollar amounts using the standard US formatting
for currency.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H4>2.4 Der Deutche Wired</H4>


<BLOCKQUOTE>This scenario involves the Web site for a German localized
version of Wired. Wired being the slick, technological magazine that it
is has already implemented XUI interfaces for its website. For this web
site, the distinction between chrome and content doesn't really exist.
In this case, since the chrome is part of the presentation of the web site.
In this case, the user wants the chrome to honor the web site designers
wishes. In this case, the chrome has german menu and buttons pointing to
various parts of the web site.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H4>2.5 European Internet Cafe</H4>


<BLOCKQUOTE>This scenario involves the computers at a European cafe.
Because of the proximity of people speaking a variety of different languages
in Europe, businesses often provide access to multiple languages.
<BR>At a public "terminal" office at the UN, or the EU or a multinational
corporation, or in a European Cybercafe, or at some sort of public kiosk
(e.g., train station) there may be systems that are available for use in
several languages (like most ATMs in this area) where the browser and web
applications need to dynamically switch the UI for different languages.
The user should be able to return to the home page and select the language
as you do for the first screen on ATMs.</BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>3.0 General Requirements</H3>


<BLOCKQUOTE>The Mozilla Locale model is intended to provide programmers
with a strategy for handling locale preferences in a way that supports
our multilingual model of web browsing.&nbsp; From the user-scenarios above,
we can outline the following principles :-</BLOCKQUOTE>

<UL>
<UL>
<P><LI>
the language of the page should usually determine the locale of the scripts
and formatting applied to elements in the page

<P><LI>
it is necessary to allow the page author to select the locale for scripts
and formatting for many instances

<P><LI>
when the content provider is providing XUI content, we should honor their
locale specifications since this is part of the presentation of their page

<P><LI>
the user must be able to select a default application locale, to control
the default UI selections
</UL>
Additionally, we have the following engineering requirements :-
<UL>
<P><LI>
Extensible Locale Support - the locale system needs to provide for "drop-in"
locale support which doesn't require modifying the base binary to add additional
locale support

<P><LI>
Extensible Locale Categories&nbsp; - the locale system needs to provide
for extending the data stored in a locale without requiring modifications
to the base binary

<P><LI>
Multiple Active Locales - the locale model needs to provide for multiple
locales being applied to different windows in the system as well as different
layers of the "application hierarchy"

<P><LI>
Interoberability = the locale model needs to interoperate with both Java
and ECMAScript locale proposal in addition to the underlying operating
system

<P><LI>
Locale model needs to support dynamic language switching

<P><LI>
good software design principles

<UL>
<LI>
lightweight

<LI>
object oriented

<LI>
easy to use for other developers
</UL>

<P><LI>
locale system needs to be available as a shared library
</UL>
</UL>

<H3>4.0 Terminology</H3>


<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H4>4.1 Locale</H4>


<BLOCKQUOTE>Locale has two different meanings. In the most general case,
a locale is a set of user preferences that are tied to the language and
location of the particular user. The preferences captured by a locale are
usually those things that change across languages and regions but aren't
necessary changed by the user. Common examples are date and currency formatting.
A locale can also be a specific instance of this collection of preferences.
Usually a locale is named by a combination of language and location, such
as en-US or en-UK representing the American and British variants of English
respectively.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H4>4.2 Locale Category</H4>


<BLOCKQUOTE>A locale is a collection of different properties. A locale
category is a particular property that can be extracted from a locale.
Traditionally the properties extracted from a locale have been called categories,
so we continue this usage.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H4>4.3 Locale Model</H4>


<BLOCKQUOTE>A locale model is a usage strategy/guide for a product. A locale
model is an abstract design about what entities in a piece of software
need to store and maintain locale information. In particular, it addresses
where locale is inherited and where it is explicitly stated.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H4>4.4 Document Tree</H4>


<BLOCKQUOTE>A model of the content of a page or document. A document tree
breaks down the elements of a document into a tree like structure. This
is taken from XML where the structure than an XML document represents is
required to take the form of a tree with a single root. This concept can
also be applied to HTML and XUI documents.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H4>4.5 XML</H4>


<BLOCKQUOTE>XML is an abbreviation for e<B>X</B>tensible <B>M</B>arkup
<B>L</B>anguage. XML is a general purpose markup language used for specifying
the structure of a document. XML is a W3C standard which can be found <A HREF="http://www.w3c.org/xml">here</A>.
For our usage, when we talk about XML, we are talking about documents or
data - specifically we are not talking about the use of XML to represent
cross platform UI resources (see XUI)</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H4>4.6 HTML</H4>


<BLOCKQUOTE><B>H</B>yper<B>T</B>ext <B>M</B>arkup <B>L</B>anguage. HTML
is the markup language used in the world wide web for authoring documents.
HTML is also a W3C standard which can be found <A HREF="http://www.w3c.org/MarkUp">here.</A>
For our purposes, HTML refers specifically to user data and content, not
cross platform UI resources implemented as markup.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H4>4.7 XUI</H4>


<BLOCKQUOTE>XUI (pronounced "Zooey")&nbsp; is a specialization of either
HTML or XML used in Mozilla to describe resources that can be rendered
by the XPFE using the ngLayout layout engine.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H4>4.8 Override</H4>


<BLOCKQUOTE>By override, we mean changing the entire locale. An example
of this would be changing the locale from US English (en-US) to French
(fr-FR). See also customization.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H4>4.9 Customization</H4>


<BLOCKQUOTE>Customization refers to changing a category of the locale.
An example of customizing would be using European (day, month, year) date
formats with the US English (en-US) locale. See also Override.</BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>5.0 Locale Model</H3>


<BLOCKQUOTE>Mozilla will be using a percolation model of locale support
connected to a document tree model. Each element in a document tree will
inherit it's initial local settings from it's parent; however, these locale
settings can be overridden by elements like &lt;xml:lang> or &lt;html:lang>
found in the document source code. At the top level, the application will
inherit it's locale from the system. The application will be inherited
element for the top of a document tree in absence of any particular document
source code overriding that inheritance. There is an assumption in the
locale model that the the presence of XUI, the document content tree is
a subset of the XUI UI tree.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H4>5.1 Percolation Model</H4>


<BLOCKQUOTE>Percolation as the name implies requires that the locale <I>percolate
down</I> from the topmost (or least specific element) in a document to
the most specific element in a document. In this percolation model, each
element will initially inherit the default locale settings from it's parent.
In the absence of an override such as an xml:lang or HTML:LANG tag, the
element will provide this locale to any children which it creates. HTML
4.0 provides for the lang attribute to be attached to any element in an
HTML document with a few exceptions (see <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/index/attributes.html">Index
of Attributes</A>.)&nbsp; The locale library will provide services which
map a particular LANG attribute/tag to a Locale object.

<P>In this model, we treat each window, at least conceptually, as a single
document.&nbsp; What is traditionally the chrome is at the root of the
document tree, and what is traditionally been the content is treated as
a frame an "&uuml;ber-document."&nbsp; As XUI and downloadable chrome become
more commonplace, there is no reason to&nbsp; make a distinction between
the two.&nbsp; Since the chrome is rooted at the top of the document tree,
the XUI selected is determined from application preferences [when the XUI
is resident on the disk] or accept language [when XUI is being fetched
from another source].&nbsp; After going through the preference/accept-language
process, the locale is known by which preference/accept-language was able
to be successfully loaded.&nbsp; Additionally, there is a requirement/convention
that XUI documents need to be labeled with both language and character
set information.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H4>5.2 Overriding</H4>


<BLOCKQUOTE>In the locale model that we are proposing, overriding involves
overriding the entire locale, not customizing it&nbsp; When the HTML parser
encounters a lang tag applied to an element, the new locale for that element
becomes whatever is specified in the lang attribute. For instance if the
parser encounters the HTML &lt;Q lang="de-DE">Hallo&lt;/Q> hat er gesagt,
then the element contained within the &lt;Q> picks up German (as spoken
in Germany) as a locale.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H4>5.3 Customization</H4>


<BLOCKQUOTE>For Mozilla, customization is not going to be allowed on general
web documents. Customization will only be allowed on the default locale
(default application UI locale). xml:lang and HTML:LANG will always map
to standard locales.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H4>5.4 Application Locale</H4>


<BLOCKQUOTE>The application locale will be determined from the default
<I>application</I> locale as provided by the underlying operating system.
The default UI language for this locale is determined from a user's accept
language setting if multiple localizations are installed or from the available
localization if only a single localization is installed. The application
is the only special case.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H4>5.4 Document Locale</H4>


<BLOCKQUOTE>Well-written HTML documents should explicitly tag themselves
with the appropriate language. In the absence of a language specification
in the page, the page will execute in the locale of the parent.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H4>5.5 XUI Locale</H4>


<BLOCKQUOTE>XUI documents/UI specification resources are expected to contain
a language specifier. The locale of the XUI document is selected by that
specifier. When multiple XUI documents are available from a server, the
browser should honor the accept-language preferences of the user and attempt
to download the matching XUI interface in the order of the accept-language
preferences.&nbsp; Since part of the XUI interfaces may be implemented
in Javascript, XUI Javascript may need to be treated as a special kind
of Javascript, written to get locale information from the locale subsystems.</BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>6.0 Locale Interfaces</H3>


<BLOCKQUOTE>The following sections outline the details of the nsLocale
object and the interfaces it provides.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H4>6.1 Locale Object</H4>


<BLOCKQUOTE>A Locale is a collection of various preferences that are related
to a customs and conventions of a particular language and region. Locale
preferences are usually related to categories like date and time formatting,
sort order, decimal separators, etc. In the API we are proposing for Mozilla,
there is a Locale object which is the token developers use to get at this
set of preferences.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H4>6.2 Locale Object Interface</H4>


<BLOCKQUOTE>The following class is taken from nsLocale.h.&nbsp; We considered
using XPCOM for implementing the&nbsp; nsLocale interface, but decided
to go with a standard C++ class.&nbsp; The XPCOM interface felt a bit awkward
for use as means of specifying a Locale.&nbsp; Secondly, the Locale system
is better represented as part of the base system, not a replaceable component
module.&nbsp; Moving away from XPCOM to C++ classes will also make the
interface lighter and simpler to use.&nbsp; Even though the interface is
not XPCOM, it will be implemented as a shared object.
<BLOCKQUOTE><TT>class nsLocale {</TT>

<P><TT>};</TT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Locales are named using a string of the form &lt;language>-&lt;country>-
&lt;variant>. This form is described according to <A HREF="http://ds.internic.net/rfc/rfc1766.txt">RFC1766</A>.
&lt;Country> and &lt;Language> are derived from the two-letter ISO standard
country and language codes. &lt;VARIANT> is a two-character (from the US-ASCII
codeset) freeform field. For example, "en-US" would be US English, whereas
"en-UK" would correspond to British English.</BLOCKQUOTE>
