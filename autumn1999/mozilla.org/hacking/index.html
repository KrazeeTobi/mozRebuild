    <h1>Hacking Mozilla</h1>
    <P>
      This is where to find what you need to know in order to check code
      in to mozilla's CVS repository. If you've never built mozilla 
      before, then you should start by looking at the 
      <A HREF="../source.html">source code</A> and building it.

    <P>
      If you have a patch to fix a bug, submit it to
      <A HREF="../bugs/">Bugzilla</A> as an attachment to that bug. Use the
      <A HREF="news://news.mozilla.org/netscape.public.mozilla.patches">
      mozilla.patches</A> newsgroup to discuss patches. When you're 
      submitting patches frequently and have an established track record 
      of good XP code then we may want to give you your own 
      checkin priviledges.

    <P>
      To get write access to the CVS tree, someone must vouch for you.
      Usually this will be a module owner. The person who vouches for you
      will be responsible for making sure you know and follow our rules
      and will be responsible for your tree breakages if you're not around
      to fix your own. 
      Vouching for another person is a big responsibility so owners need to
      take care who they vouch for. They will want to see evidence that 
      you do good work that rarely busts the tree. Usually they will want
      to see a record of patch submissions although they may skip this 
      formality for co-workers whose work they're already familiar with.
      <P>
      Before we create your account, you'll need to fill
      out the <A HREF="form.html">CVS Contributor Form</A>. Signing the 
      form indicates you understand and agree to our legal requirements.
      Breaking these rules could cause legal problems for mozilla.org 
      and may force us to revoke your CVS access. If you have any 
      questions, ask us.

      <UL>
      <LI>
      It's illegal for us to distribute crypto so don't check in 
      crypto or a crypto API. 
      <LI>
      All source files must contain a license header using 
      the <A HREF="../NPL">NPL or MPL</A> and you must provide the
      legal notices required by the license, if any.
      <LI>
      The code you check in must belong to you or you must have full
      rights to publish and license it.
      <LI>
      Your CVS account is for your own use only. Do not let others use it.
      If you check in someone else's patch, attribute the patch to them 
      in the CVS log.
      </UL>

      <P>
      Our next most important rules are those regarding the build process.
      Disregarding them wastes a lot of other people's time. Blatant 
      offenders will be pestered into compliance. Resistance is futile.

      <UL>
      <LI> 
      Learn to <A HREF="rules.html">follow the tree rules</A>.
      We inherited a build process that's been in place at Netscape
      since Communicator 4.0. It's flexible, works with a minimum
      of human intervention and has scaled to work with 
      hundreds of engineers. This process works and will continue
      to work if people follow these simple rules.

      <P>
      <LI>
      Everyone checking into the repository must do their part to keep 
      the tree green. Make sure your code builds on other platforms 
      <B>before</B> it's checked in.  After your checkin, 
      it's your responsibility to make sure tinderbox builds your 
      code sucessfully, and to be available to help fix unanticipated
      build or runtime problems. 
      <A HREF="http://www.dejanews.com/[LB=http://www.mozilla.org/]/msgid.xp?MID=<mcmullen-2404991952090001@h-208-12-40-136.mcom.com>">
      Breaking the tree wastes time</A> for many people. Don't do it. 
      </UL>

      <P>
      Other guidelines:
      <UL>
      <LI> 
      One of our primary design considerations is that our code work
      on a wide variety of platforms. There are people porting mozilla
      to small platforms using compilers that may not support all the
      latest standards. Help these platforms by following our
      <A HREF="portable-cpp.html">
      C/C++ Portability Guidelines</A> 
      and compiling with as many warnings turned on as possible.
      Maybe one day you'll find your code running on a truly marginal
      platform like your cable box or cell phone.

      <P>
      <LI>
      Read our <A HREF="../roadmap.html">development roadmap</A>.
      This is the architectural overview of where the mozilla
      browser is heading, and good reading for anyone hacking mozilla.

      <P>
      <LI>
      Learn to <A HREF="bonsai.html">use bonsai effectively</A>.
      Bonsai can be used to find all sorts of information about
      the tree. As someone checking in code to the tree, you must
      use bonsai to find out news about the tree, such as whether 
      it's open and whether there are any planned closures.

      <P>
      <LI>
      When creating a new directory, get the permission from the
      owner of the containing directory. To add a new directory to
      to the "mozilla" top-level directory, contact the  mozilla.org
      <A HREF="mailto:staff@mozilla.org">staff</A>. We
      prefer not to add new top level directories unless there is a
      very good reason. Most new projects will fit somewhere already
      in the tree like components.

      <P>
      <LI>
      When creating a new source file, put your name in the 
      "Created By" section. If appropriate,
      add yourself to the contributors section of the license 
      header of files you modify. 

      </UL>

      <P>
      Happy hacking!
