  <DT>Terminology note:
  <DD>When we speak of an <STRONG>integer</STRONG>, we usually mean a mathematical
  entity without an explicit size; on the other hand, an <STRONG>int</STRONG>
  is always a 32-bit integer and a <STRONG>long</STRONG> is always a 64-bit
  integer. Ints and longs can be interpreted as signed or unsigned integers
  depending on context.

<P><A NAME="df_phi"></A><STRONG>Phi nodes</STRONG> are special primitives

<P>Each phi node must have as many inputs as there are control graph predecessors
of the control node containing the phi node. The inputs to a phi node are
paired with these control graph predecessors. If control came to this control
node from node A, then the phi node selects its own input A; if control
came from node B, then the phi node selects its own input B, etc.</P>

<P>Usually (but not always) the input variables of a phi node are dead after
the phi node and have disjoint live ranges. We can often avoid generating
any code for the phi node by assigning all of its inputs and its output
to the same register.

Examples of unary primitives include adding a constant to a number, subtracting
a number from a constant, comparing a long to the constant 7 (<CODE>?7</CODE>

testing a condition (such as <CODE>=</CODE>, which generates 1 if a condition

<P><A NAME="df_binary"></A>Like unary primitives, <STRONG>binary primitives</STRONG>,
<STRONG>ternary primitives</STRONG>, and primitives that take more arguments
produce values that depend only on their arguments without producing any

more than once on the same set of arguments, a primitive produces the same
results. Examples of binary primitives include adding two numbers and comparing
one number to another (<CODE>?u</CODE> does an unsigned comparison).</P>

<P>Loading a non-volatile field of an object is also a binary primitive.
Note that since a load takes the <A HREF="#df_edge_store">memory</A> state
as one of its arguments (and because of Java's semantics permitting reordering
of non-volatile memory accesses as seen by other threads), a non-volatile
load satisfies the property that invoking it more than once always yields
the same value; any operation that might modify the field produces a different
memory state so the memory argument to a subsequent load of the field will
be different, thus allowing the subsequent load to return a different value.</P>

<P>Storing a field of an objet is a ternary primitive that takes a memory
state, an object reference, and a value and produces a new memory state.

<H3>Constraints</H3>


<P><FONT COLOR="#FF7F00">***** There are a zillion constraints on the placement
of data flow edges and primitives within control nodes. Many of these are
common sense (such as it's not good to get into situations where there are
two live copies of a memory state at the same time, and we better not have
any cycles of data flow edges not broken by phi-nodes), but sometime soon
we'll need to write down the rules (which may not be obvious) that ensure
these constraints.</FONT><HR ALIGN=LEFT><P></P>
