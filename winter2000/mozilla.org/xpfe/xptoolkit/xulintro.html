<p><b>Change history</b>
      <p class="history">30 Jun 99 - Merged with now obsolete Language Spec document.</p>
<h2>Preamble</h2>

<P>Mozilla has configurable, downloadable chrome, meaning that the arrangement 
  and even presence or absence of controls in the main window is not hardwired 
  into the application, but loaded from a separate UI description. In fact, most 
  of Mozilla's windows (and dialogs) will be described using this mechanism. XUL 
  (pronounced "zuul," as if that spelling helped any, and short for "XML-based 
  User Interface Language") is our name for the language in which these UI descriptions 
  are built.</P>

<P>Window chrome is displayed and managed by the same layout engine that manages 
  HTML content in the browser. UI descriptions, then, look a great deal like HTML 
  4. XUL is an application of XML. In fact, it <I>is</I> just XML with specific 
  meaning defined for a few element types, and into which HTML can be scattered.</P>

<H2>Terms</H2>

<P>"XPFE" is the term Mozilla-the-organization is using to describe
Mozilla-the-browser's Cross Platform Front End, because X and C look
similar if you beat them long and hard with a hammer. The intention
is to build cross-platform applications like browsers and mail
clients from a set of tools designed for that purpose. The intention
is <I>not</I> to implement a generic cross-platform application
framework. That's been done, and is a great deal of work. We intend
to provide a subset of cross-platform functionality suitable for
building network applications like browsers, leveraging the
cross-platform functionality already built into Gecko, Mozilla's HTML
layout engine.</P>

<P>The term "cross-platform UI" is somewhat misleading. UI designers
will be able to create UI descriptions which will work on multiple
platforms. But proper UI descriptions which take into account various
platforms' differing ideas about proper placement of such things as
dialog buttons will require some platform-specific work. A single XUL
specification can only cross-platform to a degree. UI designers and
build engineers will need to maintain separate, platform-specific
versions of at least some XUL documents.</P>

<P>"XPToolkit" is rather synonymous with XPFE. Though the former term
seems more concrete than the other, and therefore is not an exact
replacement, no one is completely certain why we have both.</P>

<P>"XUL" already introduced, is an application of XML used to
describe the layout of most windows in the Mozilla browser, including
and especially the main, browser window.</P>

<H2>Scope</H2>

<P>This paper makes no attempt to explain requirements. We don't have a current 
  "requirements" document. <A HREF="../aom/AOM.html">XPToolkit Architecture</A> 
  is a better place to gain an understanding of such things. This paper contains 
  a short introduction to Mozilla front-end architecture, concentrating on the 
  task of building UIs. It is, as always, incomplete.</P>

<P>Mozilla applications will be built of "small" components like
dialog buttons and mail inbox folders, which we collectively term
"widgets." Within a widget, drawing and user interactions are
completely under control of the individual widget, and set when the
widget was built. Relative placement of widgets, their interactions
with each other, and optionally some of their configuration, will be
controlled by a UI layout specified in a script whose structure is
defined in this and related documents.</P>

<P>Widgets are pieces of the application largely self-contained,
generally corresponding to a rectangle of window real estate. Widgets
will generally live grouped in separate, dynamically loaded
libraries. A widget may expect to own a piece of a window (a toolbar
or toolbar set), or it may be expected to work within or without a
window (menubars, depending on the platform). It may not be a part of
the application UI at all.</P>

<P>Widgets will have predefined behaviour, set at compilation. Buttons will respond 
  to the mouse; toolbars will act as containers for buttons. The effect a widget 
  will have on its application will be defined as a combination of predefined 
  application behaviour and linkage between the widgets. This linkage can be accomplished 
  by including JavaScript in the XUL, or by application code which walks the content 
  model after it has been built from XUL, and hooks up event listeners. Generally 
  a real application will use some combination of the two.</P>
<P>Applications, for instance, will have preconceived notions of what to do when 
  they receive an "open file" command. An "open" button is simply a button. It 
  will send its command to the application for processing, generally using some 
  simple JavaScript for linkage.</P>

<P>We are at first primarily concerned with the obvious UI
components: toolbars, menus and dialogs. Conceptually, the XUL
language will allow someone with a text editor, given a package of
components which can work together, the ability to put together an
application by specifying something like this (for an application on
an OS using menubars across the top of its applications'
windows):</P>

<PRE>main window containing
  menubar area at top across width of window containing
    menubar (and its contents)
  toolbar area below menubar across width of window containing
    main toolbar (and its contents)
  application-specific content area below toolbar area</PRE>

<H2>Structure of a XUL File</H2>

      <P>Our language of choice is <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/XML/">XML</A>, flavoured 
        with <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2">CSS</A> stylistic information. 
        Having said that, the details of a particular application of XML; say, 
        the syntax for specifying a toolbar, are left to separate documents describing 
        those particular applications. Check the <a href="../index.html">XPToolkit 
        index</a> for the most recent list.</P>
      <P>Since XUL is a language for describing window layout, there is some overlap 
        in the topics covered by this document and a separate document describing 
        XUL <a href="windows.html">windows</a>. The task of writing a XUL window 
        description is basically the same as the task of writing an HTML content 
        description, with these exceptions: the syntax is XML (not that different 
        from HTML 4), and there are some elements unique to XUL. These elements 
        are widgets and certain infrastructure associated with the behaviour of 
        the window, explained below.</P>
      <P>Most of the details of writing a XUL document are identical to those for writing 
  an XML document, a description of which we will leave to other excellent XML 
  documentation which we assume must exist but have never seen. This document 
  will concentrate on XUL-specific features.</P>
<h3>A Word on Case and Namespaces, and Filetypes</h3>
<p>XML is of course case sensitive. XUL is equally so. Our current code tends 
  not to be strict about enforcing this, especially for tags and attributes in 
  the HTML namespace. This will change: tags and attributes will, as a rule, always 
  be lower case as suggested in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-html-in-xml/">XHTML 
  Working Draft</a>.</p>
      <p>Mozilla gives a special meaning to XUL files; it expects to find UI descriptions 
        within. For this reason, we've defined a MIME type "text/xul" mapped to 
        files with the extension ".xul". (For standards purposes, we will probably 
        need to change the the mime type to something like "text/x-xul".) These 
        files are processed using the same parser as "text/xml" files (and therefore 
        subject to XML syntax rules, as they should be). It's possible to load 
        a XUL document from an XML file (one named *.xml). The resulting UI will 
        be created using an XML content model. A XUL content model is generated 
        from *.xul files. XML documents support the basic DOM Level 1 Core APIs. 
        XUL documents support an extended set, much as HTML documents support 
        DOM Level 1 HTML APIs. Mozilla's XUL content models also support nifty 
        features like local/remote merging; see the <a href="../xulrdf.htm">XUL 
        and RDF document</a> for details. In general, you will want to store XUL 
        in *.xul files. </p>
      <p>A XUL file can contain XML elements and HTML elements, as well as special 
        elements unique to XUL: XUL elements. <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml-names/">Namespace</a> 
        declarations for XUL (and HTML, if HTML elements are used) must be included 
        in the file. Namespaces must be treated carefully. Correct namespace usage 
        dictates that the namespace be used only for the tag, not in individual 
        attributes. Rare exceptions to this rule are bugs.</p>
<h3></h3>
      <h3><a name="preamble"></a>XUL File Preamble</h3>
<P>XUL is XML, and a good XUL file begins with the standard XML version and DOCTYPE 
  statements.</P>
      <P>Since XML has no implicit display semantics, there must always be associated 
        stylesheets. Mozilla includes a standard stylesheet, "xul.css". You can 
        load as many style sheets as you wish using repeated processing directives, 
        although you should always make sure to load the xul.css file initially. 
        And finally, any namespaces used in the document must be declared. So 
        a XUL file will begin</P>
<table border=1 align=center width=80% bgcolor=#d0d0d0>
<tr><td><pre><code>&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
&lt;?xml-stylesheet href="chrome://global/skin/xul.css" type="text/css"?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE window&gt;
&lt;window xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40"
  xmlns="http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul&quot;&gt;</code></pre>
</td></tr></table>

      <P>The HTML namespace is of course the standard one. The XUL namespace is 
        obviously a temporary one, but at least serves to explain the pronunciation. 
        Note that the above example is using an implicit XUL namespace. This is 
        optional; other examples in this document will on occasion belabor the 
        namespace issue by declaring each use explicitly</P>
      <P> The <code>chrome</code> protocol is another Mozilla extension allowing 
        the exact location of files involved in the chrome description to be moved 
        without affecting the XUL source. So it's just an indirection. Someday, 
        there will be a complete description of this mechanism at <a href="packages.html">packages</a>, 
        but for now there's a good but somewhat out of date document at <a href="../ConfigChromeSpec.html">Configurable 
        Chrome</a>.</P>
      <H3>Scripting</H3>
<P>A XUL interface is only a collection of disconnected widgets until it has been 
  programmed. &quot;Programming&quot; can be as simple as some JavaScript to tie 
  the widgets together and perhaps to give them extra functionality, or as complex 
  as application (C++) code which is free to do ... anything. This paper will 
  concentrate on JavaScript, deeming application programming to be beyond its 
  scope.</P>

<h4>JavaScript</h4>

<P>XUL can contain HTML content, including JavaScript. JavaScript functions may 
  be added in a fashion similar to HTML. There is no <CODE>&lt;head&gt;</CODE> 
  section of a XUL file, so script is just mixed in with the other content, delimited 
  by a <CODE>&lt;script&gt;</CODE> tag in the HTML namespace.</P>

<table border=1 align=center width=80% bgcolor=#d0d0d0>
<tr><td><pre><code>&lt;html:script&gt;
  // dialog initialization code
  function InitWindow() {
    var checkbox = document.getElementByID("remember");
    if (checkbox)
      checkbox.checked = true;
  }
&lt;/html:script&gt;</code></pre>
</td></tr></table>
<p>JavaScript can be referenced as in HTML documents: as <code>onClick</code> 
handlers and the like. See individual widget documentation referenced 
at the <a href="../index.html">index</a> for a list of attributes accepting 
JavaScript values.</p>
<p>JavaScript is most safely kept in a separate file and included in the XUL file</p>
<p><table border=1 align=center width=80% bgcolor=#d0d0d0>
<tr><td><pre><code>&lt;html:script language=&quot;javascript&quot; src=&quot;our.js&quot;/&gt;</code></pre>
</td></tr></table>
<p>or relegated to the contents of a CDATA section, to prevent the XML parser 
  from choking on JavaScript which may look like XML content (a <code>&lt;</code> 
  character, for instance.)</p>
<table border=1 align=center width=80% bgcolor=#d0d0d0>
<tr><td><pre><code>&lt;html:script&gt;
  &lt;![CDATA[
    function lesser(a,b) {
      return a &lt; b ? a : b;
    }
  ]]&gt;
&lt;/html:script&gt;</code></pre>
</td></tr></table>
      <h4>JavaScript Extensions</h4>
      <p>Mozilla has found it necessary to make a few extensions to JavaScript, 
        to support new features not conceived of in a strictly browser environment. 
        These are currently nonstandard, of course, and subject to change for 
        now. Individual extensions are described in individual documents dedicated 
        to the features requiring the extensions.</p>
      <h4>DOM Extensions</h4>
<p>Since XUL is not the same thing as HTML, while XUL documents will support the 
  DOM Level 1 Core API, they will not support the DOM Level 1 HTML API. However, 
  Mozilla supports extended DOM functionality for the XUL content model, patterned 
  after the HTML extensions. At this time these additional DOM methods are available, 
  though the code is of course the most accurate place to look for this information. 
  These interfaces can be found in the directory <code>mozilla/rdf/content/public/idl</code>.</p>
<h5>XULDocument</h5>
<p><code>XULDocument</code> extends <code>Document</code> in a fashion similar 
  to <code>HTMLDocument</code>'s extension</p>
<pre><code>interface XULDocument : Document {

  Element getElementById(in DOMString id);
  NodeList getElementsByAttribute(in DOMString name, in DOMString value);
};</code></pre>
<p><code>getElementById</code> works like HTML's <code>getElementById</code>.</p>
<p><code>getElementsByAttribute</code> returns a list of <code>Elements</code> 
  for which the named attribute has the given value. A <code>value</code> of &quot;*&quot; 
  is a wildcard signifying all elements with the attribute.</p>
<h5>XULElement</h5>
<p><code>XULElement</code> extends <code>Element</code>.</p>
<pre><code>interface XULElement : Element {
  NodeList getElementsByAttribute(in DOMString name, in DOMString value);
};</code></pre>
<p><code>getElementsByAttribute</code> functions as does its namesake in <code>XULDocument</code>, 
  though this version returns only those elements which match the criteria and 
  are descendants (in CSS selector terminology) of the given element.</p>
<p><code>XULElement</code> also supports other methods for hooking up broadcasters; 
  a function performed automatically by the XUL document loader and therefore 
  not normally used in JavaScript.</p>
<H3>XUL Elements</H3>

<P>As mentioned above, a XUL file is mostly an HTML file with XML
syntax. A XUL file may contain nothing but HTML elements and be
completely functional. But XUL defines several element types unique
to itself, which add functionality to the window.</P>

<H4>Widgets</H4>

      <P>Widgets are generally objects like form controls: buttons, text boxes, 
        tree controls and the like. A window can just as easily contain HTML form 
        elements (using the <CODE>html</CODE> namespace) like any HTML content 
        (though there is no need to put them within a <CODE>&lt;form&gt;</CODE> 
        tag). In fact, XUL largely uses extant widgets from HTML, with a few some 
        extensions and additions. Each widget will define a unique XML syntax 
        for describing itself; see the widget documentation referenced at the 
        <a href="../index.html">index</a> for details.</P>

      <H4>Other Infrastructure</H4>

<P>Widgets may have JavaScript event handlers just as in HTML, and
are tied together using JavaScript and broadcaster nodes. Broadcaster
nodes are declared as <CODE>&lt;broadcaster&gt;</CODE> elements in
the XUL description, and are involved with the communication of
changes of state between widgets. A widget or several widgets can
arrange to have the value of one of their attributes be tied to a
broadcaster node. This tie is defined within the XUL:</P>

<table border=1 align=center width=80% bgcolor=#d0d0d0>
<tr><td> 
<pre><code>&lt;xul:window
    xmlns="http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul"&gt; 
  &lt;broadcaster id="canGoBack"/&gt;
  &lt;titledbutton src="resource:/res/toolbar/TB_Back.gif"
    align="bottom" value="Back" onclick="BrowserBack()"&gt;
    &lt;observes element="canGoBack" attribute="disabled"/&gt;
  &lt;/titledbutton&gt;
&lt;/window&gt;</code></pre>
</td></tr></table>
<P>But it is up to the application code to locate the broadcasters
within a window so it can punch them when necessary.</P>

      <P>Broadcasters can broadcast any change of state, which can be tied to the value 
        of any attribute in another XUL widget. For more complete documentation, 
        see <A HREF="broadcasters.html">Broadcasters and Observers</A>.</P>
      <h2>An Example Window</h2>

      <p>Below is a complete sample XUL document that describes a window with 
        a menu bar and an HTML content area. The menu bar has a menu, <i>File</i>, 
        with a single menu item that dumps "Hello world!" to the debug console 
        when selected. The content area will display the contents of the file 
        contentframe.html. This code introduces several concepts useful for creating 
        real world windows not explicitly covered in this document. Follow the 
        links for details.
      <p> 
<table border=1 align=center width=80% bgcolor=#d0d0d0>
<tr><td> 
            <pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; 
&lt;?xml-stylesheet href="chrome://global/skin/xul.css" type="text/css"?&gt; 

&lt;!DOCTYPE window&gt; 

&lt;window id="main-window" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40"
        xmlns="http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul"&gt; 
  &lt;menubar&gt;
      &lt;menu name="File"&gt;
        &lt;menuitem name="Hello World!" onclick="dump('Hello world!\n');"/&gt;
      &lt;/menu&gt;
  &lt;/menubar&gt; 
  &lt;html:iframe id="content-frame" src="contentframe.html" flex="100%"/&gt;
&lt;/window&gt;
</pre>
</td></tr></table>
<p> The beginning of this example, down through the window tag, is the standard 
<a href="#preamble">preamble</a>. 
<p> Notice that the example window tag has an id attached to it. Strictly 
speaking, that is unnecessary for this example. However in practice, most 
nodes in XUL have these identifiers, which enable the nodes to be retrieved 
easily using the AOM's <tt>getElementById</tt> method. Identifiers are 
also useful for CSS, since rules can be applied to individual elements 
in XUL using the same # syntax that is possible for HTML elements. 
<pre><code>
#main-window {
  display: block;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
}</code></pre>
<p> For example, the above style rule would apply to the main window and 
dictates that the window should consume the full width and height available 
to it in a content area. 

      <p> The next element in the example declares the menubar. The menubar contains 
        a single menu called &quot;File&quot;. This menu contains a single menu 
        item that has a simple JavaScript <code>onclick</code> handler attached 
        to it. This handler fires when the menu is selected by the user, and it 
        dumps the text &quot;Hello world!&quot; to the debug console. (See <a href="menus.html">Menu 
        Bars and Menus</a> for details.) 
      <p> Finally there is an HTML <code>iframe</code>. Note that the frame is 
        qualified with the prefix <code>html:</code>, since it is an HTML object 
        being used inside a default XUL namespace. The frame also has a special 
        attribute called <code>flex</code>, which indicates how much the frame 
        is allowed to stretch to consume available space inside its window. (See 
        <a href="boxes.html">The Box System</a> for details). 
      <h2>Idealistic Future Direction</h2>

<P>Ideally, packages of XUL UI descriptions could be shipped in a
single file something like</P>

<PRE><CODE>&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
&lt;?xml-stylesheet href="xul.css" type="text/css"?&gt;

<P>And a window (or other service) could be instantiated by first
parsing the whole package and then picking out a window from its
contents</P>

<PRE><CODE>Package *package = LoadPackage("http://xxx/package.xul");
InstantiateWindow(package, GetNodeWithID("main");
</CODE></PRE>

<P>This happy scheme doesn't work today, because the code expects the
result of parsing an XML document to be a window. So currently, a
single XUL file must contain a single window.</P>

<PRE><CODE>&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
&lt;?xml-stylesheet href="xul.css" type="text/css"?&gt; 
&lt;!DOCTYPE window&gt;
&lt;window xmlns="http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul"&gt; 
  ...
&lt;/window&gt;</CODE></PRE>
<P>We would like to head more toward the "package" implementation in
the future.</P>

<H2>Internationalization</H2>

<P>For practical reasons, the locale-specific attributes of a UI description would 
  be most happily developed (and possibly distributed) in separate files, where 
  localization can be performed by altering only a subset of the UI description 
  devoted expressly to localization issues. That is, a separate file of localized 
  strings.</P>

      <P>Internationalization is discussed more completely in the <a href="../../projects/intl/xul-styleguide.html">XUL 
        Coding Style Guidelines</a> document. In brief, Mozilla has settled on 
        <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-xml-19980210#sec-references">XML 
        entities</A> as the mechanism. Entities are a feature of the language 
        and therefore outside the scope of this paper. A XUL file can be made 
        localizeable very easily by substituting entities for any content which 
        may change as the locale changes. The localized text must be defined in 
        a separate <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-xml-19980210#sec-prolog-dtd">DTD</A> 
        or DTD fragment. The whole system is then configured with different locale-specific 
        DTDs, and the correct DTD will be chosen for a given XML file at runtime, 
        depending on the current locale settings. Mozilla will make that decision 
        automatically if the localized XML file specifies its DTD using a <a href="../ConfigChromeSpec.html">chrome 
        URL</a>, as outlined in <a href="../../projects/intl/xul-l10n.html#l12ydependency">XUL 
        Localizability Issues</a>.</P>
