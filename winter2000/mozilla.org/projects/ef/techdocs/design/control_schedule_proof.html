<P></P>

<P>Here we prove that <A HREF="control_schedule.html#phase3d">phase 3d</A>
of our scheduling algorithm will (1) terminate and (2) not get stuck.</P>

<H2>Termination</H2>


<P>The algorithm terminates because at each point either:</P>

<OL>
  <LI>The number of elements in W goes down by one, possibly increasing the
  size of the stack T, or
  <LI>The number of elements on the stack T goes down by one.
</OL>

<P>By induction, since both the size of W and the size of T are initially
positive and finite, both must eventually reach zero.</P>

<H2>Liveness</H2>


<P>The algorithm does not get stuck if, as long as at least one of T and
W isn't empty, we can choose one of the three alternatives in <A HREF="control_schedule.html#phase3d">phase
3d</A>. We will prove that, in fact, either alternative 2 or alternative
3 will apply.</P>

<P>Let LOOPS be the set of immediately nested loops in REG that contain
at least one working node.</P>

<P>Let CLIQUES be the set of cliques obtained by scheduling LOOPS.</P>

<P><B>Lemma 1.</B> <I>Every short edge incoming to a node in R originates
from a node in R or from the last node of some clique in CLIQUES.</I> This
holds because of conditions 1 and 5 in <A HREF="control_schedule.html#phase3b">phase
3b</A> and because once an edge is designated a long edge it is never changed
to a short edge.</P>

<P><B>Lemma 2.</B> <I>Every short edge incoming to a node in W originates
from either W, the current node P, the last node of some clique on the stack
T, or the last node of some clique in the schedule S<FONT SIZE=-2>L</FONT>,
where L's header is in W</I>. We can prove this by induction. By lemma 1,
it holds in the base case when W is R - {H}, P is H, and every immediate
subloop's header is in W. For the induction case, we note that:</P>

<OL>
  <LI>Each time we assign a new value to P, we make every outgoing edge from
  the old P node into a long edge.
  <LI>Each time we remove a node N from W that is not the header of a subloop,
  we assign P := N.
  <LI>Each time we remove a node N from W that is the header of a subloop
  L, we take one of L's cliques and assign its last node to P and we push
  the remaining cliques of L onto the stack T.
  <LI>Each time we pop a clique from the stack T, we assign its last node
  to P.
</OL>

<P>In each of the above cases, if the induction hypothesis held before our
action, it will hold after it as well.</P>

<P><B>Lemma 3.</B> <I>Let F be the subgraph of the function's control graph
consisting only of forward, exception, and return edges. F is acyclic ,
every node in F is reachable from the function's begin node via edges in
F, and the short edges form subgraph of F</I>. F is acyclic by constraint
<A HREF="control_layer.html#CYCLES1">CYCLES1</A> on the control flow graph.
Every node in F is reachable from the function's begin node via edges in
F by constraint <A HREF="control_layer.html#CONNECTED1">CONNECTED1</A> on
the control flow graph. The short edges form a subgraph of F by the initial
construction of short edges in <A HREF="control_schedule.html#phase3b">phase
3b</A>, where we defined every backward edge to be a long edge.</P>

<P><B>Liveness.</B> Let us assume that we are stuck (none of the three alternatives
applies) and we will show that we have scheduled all nodes in R. Let T be
our current stack and W be our current subset of R - {H}. T must be empty;
otherwise we could apply alternative 2 and we would not be stuck.</P>

<P>Let F be as defined in lemma 3. Since F is acyclic, we can number all
nodes in the control graph with unique numbers such that the source of any
edge E in F has a number lower than the target of E. By lemma 3, the source
of any short edge has a number strictly less than the target of that edge.</P>

<P>If W is nonempty, let X be the node in W with the smallest number. By
lemma 2, the only short edges pointing to X must be from one of the following
sources:</P>

<OL>
  <LI>a node in W
  <LI>P,
  <LI>the last node of some clique on the stack T, or
  <LI>the last node of some clique in the schedule S<FONT SIZE=-2>L</FONT>,
  where L's header is in W.
</OL>

<P>Case 1 cannot apply because X's predecessor would be in W and yet have
a smaller number than X, contradicting our choice of X. Case 3 cannot apply
because T is empty.</P>

<P>Suppose case 4 applies to X. Let L be any immediate subloop of REG that
contains a node A such that A-&gt;X is a short edge, and let H<FONT SIZE=-2>L</FONT>
be the header of loop L. By the definition of a loop, H<FONT SIZE=-2>L</FONT>
dominates A, so H<FONT SIZE=-2>L</FONT>'s number must be less than or equal
to A's number, which in turn is strictly less than X's number. Now, since
case 4 applied to X, H<FONT SIZE=-2>L</FONT> is itself a member of W with
a number less than X, which contradicts our choice of X. Hence case 4 cannot
apply.</P>

<P>Suppose case 2 applies to X. In this case node X is ready with respect
to P, so we can choose alternative 3, contradicting the assumption that
we are stuck. Thus, case 4 cannot apply to X either.</P>

<P>Since none of the cases can apply to X, there must be no such X, implying
that W is empty and we have already scheduled all nodes in R.<HR ALIGN=LEFT><P></P>
