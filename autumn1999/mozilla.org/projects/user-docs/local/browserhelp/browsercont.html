<a NAME="nav_view"></a>
<h2>Viewing a Page</h2>

<p>When you start your Mozilla-based browser, you see your "home page." Unless you <!-- Ça href="#nav_home"È -->choose a home page<!-- Ç/aÈ --> yourself, your home page is chosen by your network or Internet service provider, or you see the default home page, mozilla.org.</p>

<p>If you're viewing your home page for the first time, explore it. If clicking something takes you to a different page, click Back to retrace your steps.</p>

<p>Some pages are divided into rectangular areas called frames. Each frame can display other pages.</p> 

<p>To refresh the current page, or get the most up-to-date version:</p>

<ul>
<li>Click Reload.</li>
</ul>

<p>To view more than one page at a time:</p>

<ul>
<li>From the File menu, choose New, then Browser Window.</li>
</ul>

<p>At first the new window displays a copy of your home page, but you can use it to view a different page.<p>

<p>

<br>


<a NAME="nav_openpage"></a>
<h2>Moving to Another Page</h2>

<p>You move to a new page by typing its URL--its location (address) on the Web.</p>

<p></p>
<ol>
<li>On Windows and Unix, open the File menu and choose Open Page.</li>
<p>On Mac OS, open the File menu and choose Open.</p>
<li>Type the new URL, then click Open.</li>
</ol>

<p>Shortcut: Click the Location (or Netsite) field, type the URL, and press Enter.

<p><B>Don't know a URL?</B> You can type part of a URL, such as "apple" (for www.apple.com); or type a general word, such as "gifts" or "flowers." The Mozilla-based browser guesses what page you want to view, or displays a page with a choice of links related to the word you typed.</p>

<p>If you are new to the Internet, type this URL to view a tutorial for novices: 
http://home.netscape.com/browsers/using/navtutorial.html.</p>
 
<p>To move by clicking a link:</p>

<ol>
<li>Move the pointer until it changes to a pointing finger. This happens whenever the pointer is over a link.</li>
<p></p>
<li>Click the link once. While the network locates the page the link points to, status messages appear at the bottom of the window.</li>
</ol>

<p>To move to related pages:</p>

<ul>
<li>Click "What's Related" and choose from the list.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you change your mind and don't want to view a page, click Stop.</p>

<!-- Troubleshooting: I clicked a link, but it led to a page that said the link has moved or can't be found.
The website that created the link has moved or removed the link.  -->

<a NAME="nav_save"></a>
<h2>Saving a Page</h2>

<p>To save an entire page:</p>

<ul>
<li>Choose Save As from the File menu.
</ul>

<p>When you view a page containing frames and a frame is currently selected, the File menu's Save Frame As option is offered in addition to Save As. This lets you save only the page within the selected frame.</p>

<p>Saving a file onto your hard disk lets you view the page (or its HTML code) when you're not connected to the Internet.</p>

<p>To save an image from a page:</p>

<ol>
<li>Right-click the image (on Mac OS, press and hold the mouse button) to display a pop-up menu.
<p></p>
<li>Choose Save Image As.
</ol>

<p>To save a page without displaying it (useful for retrieving a nonformatted page, like a data file, that's not intended for viewing):</p>

<ol>
<li>Right-click the page's link (on Mac OS, press and hold the mouse button) to display a pop-up menu.
<p></p>
<li>Choose Save Link As.
</ol>

<p><B>Important:</B> Some links automatically download and save files to disk after you click them. The URLs for these links often begin with "ftp" or end with a file-type suffix such as "au" or "mpeg". These links might transmit software, sound, or movie files, and can launch helper applications that support the files.</p>

<ul>
<li>Click Print.
</ul>

<p>On Windows, you can choose Print Preview from the File menu to see how the printed page will look.

<p><B>Note:</B> When you view a page containing frames, the File menu contains Print Frame in place of Print.</p>

<p>To set up the page layout for printing (optional):</p>

<ol>
<li>From the File menu, choose Page Setup.
<p></p>
<li>Choose page layout options, including header and footer information.
</ol>

<p><B>Important:</B> The browser formats content according to the size of the printed page, not the size of the onscreen window. Text is word-wrapped and graphics are repositioned to accommodate paper size.</p>

<a NAME="nav_cookie"></a>
<h2>Cookie Management</h2>

<p>A "cookie" is a small amount of information that a web site copies to your hard disk. A cookie can help a web site identify you the next time you visit. For instance, if you shop for books online, the bookstore's web site might use a cookie to store information about your favorite subjects, and later use that information to recommend particular books.</p>

<p>To control your computer's behavior with respect to cookies:</p>

<ol>
<li>From the Edit menu, choose Preferences.
<p></p>
<li>Click the Advanced category.
<p></p>
<li>Click one of the radio buttons.

<p>Important: In most cases, "Accept all cookies" is the best choice. The second button means that your computer will not send a cookie to a server that did not originate it.</p>

<li>If you want to be notified when your browser accepts a cookie, check "Warn me before accepting a cookie."

<a NAME="nav_autoload"></a>
<h2>Automatic Loading</h2>

<p>When you bring a web page to your screen, the browser automatically loads (starts up) several features that help interpret web pages. These features can make web pages more lively, but they take time to load.</p>

<p>To turn off automatic loading:</p>

<ol>
<li>From the Edit menu, choose Preferences.
<p></p>
<li>Click the Advanced category.
<p></p>
<li>To speed things up, deselect one or more of the following:
<p></p>
	<ul>
	<li>Automatically load images. Automatically displays images in a web page when you view the page. If unselected, images are replaced by small icons, and you click the Images button in the toolbar to view the images.
	<p></p>
	<li>Enable Java. Allows Java applets (small programs that add functionality to pages) to run automatically.
	<p></p>
	<li>Enable JavaScript. Allows JavaScript (commands that add functionality to pages) to run automatically.
	<p></p>
	<li>Enable style sheets. Displays pages formatted by style sheets as the author intended. If unselected, author's formats aren't included.
	<p></p>
	<li>Enable Autoinstall. Allows Mozilla software to be automatically updated over your office or organization's network. (In some organizations, this is predetermined by a system administrator.)
	<p></p>
	<li>Send email address as anonymous FTP password. Transmits your email address automatically when 	you log on to a public FTP (File Transfer Protocol) site. FTP sites are used for transferring files.
</ul>
</ol>

<br>
<br>


<a NAME="nav_cache"></a>
<h2>Changing Cache Settings</h2>

<p>Your computer stores copies of frequently accessed pages in the memory cache or disk cache. This way, the computer doesn't have to retrieve the page from the network each time you view it.</p>

<p>To set the size of the memory cache or to clear it (Windows and Unix only):</p>

<ol>
<li>From the Edit menu, choose Preferences.
<p></p>
<li>Open the Advanced category; then click Cache.
<p></p>
<li>Enter a number in the Memory Cache field to specify the size of the memory cache. 1024K to 2000K is a good size.
<p></p>
<li>To clear the Memory Cache immediately, click Clear Memory Cache.
</ol>

<p><B>Important:</B> A larger memory cache allows more data to be quickly retrieved. But unless you have a lot of extra memory on your computer, 1024K is large enough.</p>

<p>To set the size of the disk cache or to clear it:</p>

<ol>
<li>From the Edit menu, choose Preferences.
<p></p>
<li>Open the Advanced category; then click Cache.
<p></p>
<li>Enter a number in the Disk Cache field to specify the size of the disk cache. 7680K (5000K on Unix) is a good size.
<p></p>
<li>(Optional) To specify where the disk cache should be stored, click Choose Folder, find the folder you want, and double-click to select it.
<p></p>
<li>To clear the Disk Cache immediately, click Clear Disk Cache.
</ol>

<p><B>Important:</B> A larger disk cache allows more pages to be quickly retrieved, but more of your hard disk space is used.</p>

<p>When you quit your browser, it performs cache maintenance. If maintenance takes longer than you wish, try reducing the size of the disk cache.</p>

<p>To specify how often your Mozilla-based browser checks the network for page revisions (so that you don't keep "stale" pages in the cache too long):</p>

<ol>
<li>From the Edit menu, choose Preferences.
<p></p>
<li>Click the Advanced category; then click Cache.
<p></p>
<li>Select Once Per Session, Every Time, or Never. "Every Time" assures that the page you see is always the latest, at the cost of slower performance. "Never" is fastest, but the page you see might be stale. 
</ol>

<p>To refresh a page at any time:</p>

<ul>
<li>Click Reload. The computer checks the network to make sure you have the latest version of the page. To retrieve a fresh copy of a page regardless of what's in the cache, hold down the Shift key (Option key on Mac OS) and click Reload.
</ul>

<p>If pages that should be in the cache are taking longer to appear than they should, make sure the preference is not set to Every Time, because the verification requires a network connection that takes time.</p>

<a NAME="nav_smartup"></a>
<h2>Getting the Latest Software Automatically</h2>

<p>SmartUpdate allows software to be automatically and securely installed on your machine in one step.</p>

<p>To turn SmartUpdate on or off:</p>

<ol>

<li>Open the Edit menu and choose Preferences.</li>

<p></p>

<li>Open the Advanced group and click SmartUpdate.</li>

<p></p>

	<ul>
	
	<li>Select Enable SmartUpdate to turn it on.</li>
	
	<p></p>
	
	<li>Select "Require manual confirmation of each install" if you want to be notified each time SmartUpdate tries to install a program or file on your computer.</li>
	
	<p></p>
	
	<li>To uninstall a SmartUpdate item, select one of the 	SmartUpdates on the left side and click the Uninstall button.</li>

<a NAME="nav_smartbrowse"></a>
<h2>Finding the Pages You Want</h2>

<p>The Smart Browsing feature helps you quickly find what you want on the Internet (and filter out what you don't want). It includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>What's Related: A list of URLs (addresses) for web sites related to the page you're currently viewing. To view related sites, click the What's Related button and select from the list.
<p></p>
<li>Internet Keywords: A shorthand way of typing addresses into the Location field.
<p></p>
<li>NetWatch: A protection feature that lets you control the type of web pages that can be viewed on your computer. To use NetWatch, open the Help menu and choose NetWatch.
</ul>

<p>To set up Smart Browsing:</p>

<ol>
<li>From the Edit menu, choose Preferences.
<p></p>
<li>Open the Browser category and click Smart Browsing.
<p></p>
<li>Select Enable "What's Related."
<p></p>
<li>Select an option under "Automatically load 'What's Related' information." This option determines when the browser fetches the related sites' URLs.
	<ul>
	<li>Never: The browser waits until you click the What's Related button to fetch related sites' URLs.
	<p></p>
	<li>Always: The browser fetches the related sites' URLs automatically as soon as you visit a web page, whether or not you 	click the What's Related button. (Pages load more slowly, but the button responds more quickly.)
	<p></p>
	<li>After first use: Once you've clicked What's Related while visiting a page, the Browser fetches the information automatically whenever you return to that page. If you've never clicked What's Related while visiting a particular page, 	the Browser doesn't fetch the related sites' URLs.
	</ul>
<p></p>
<li>(Optional) List any domains for which you don't want related information. Domain names are the part of a URL that contains the name of an organization, business, or school--such as netscape.com or mozilla.org.
<p></p>
<li>Select Enable Internet Keywords if you want to type common words or brand names (instead of full URLs) in the Location field.
</ol>

<a NAME="nav_prox"></a>
<h2>Setting Proxy Values</h2>

<p>Many organizations block access from the Internet to their networks. This prevents outside parties from gaining access to sensitive information. The protection is called a firewall.</p>

<p>If your organization has a firewall, the Mozilla-based browser may need to go through a proxy server before connecting you to the Internet. The proxy server prevents outsiders from breaking into your organization's private network.</p>

<p>Before you start:</p>

<ul>
<li>If there's a proxy configuration file at your workplace, ask the system administrator for its URL.
<p></p>
<li>If there's no proxy configuration file, ask your system administrator for the names and port numbers of the servers running proxy software for each network service.
</ul>

<p>To set your browser to work with the proxy:</p>

<ol>
<li>From the Edit menu, choose Preferences.
<p></p>
<li>Click the Advanced category and choose Proxies.
<p></p>
<li>Select one of the following:
<p></p>
	<ul>
	<li>"Direct Connection to the Internet" if you don't have to go through a proxy.
	<p></p>
	<li>"Automatic proxy configuration" if you have a proxy configuration file. Type the file's URL in the field and click Reload.
	<p></p>
	<li>"Manual proxy configuration" if you don't have a proxy configuration file. Click View
	(Configure on Mac OS), and type your settings and any exceptions (see Details below).
	</ul>
</ol>

<p>Details: Your computer may connect to several different servers (computers that handle networking matters). Each server handles a specific type of network service, such as communicating with HTTP sites or dealing with security. For each server, your manual configuration must specify which server runs the proxy software.</p>

<p>Under "Address of proxy server to use," type the name or numeric IP address of the proxy server for each type of server (HTTP, Security, FTP, Socks, Gopher, and WAIS). Often a single proxy server handles the three major types of server: HTTP, FTP, and Gopher. Under "Port" type each proxy server's port number.</p>

<p>Under Exceptions, type the names of any domains that you can connect to directly, bypassing the proxy. For example, if you type "mozilla.org," then the proxy is bypassed each time you view a web page from mozilla.org. Domain names are the part of a URL that contains the name of an organization, business, or school--such as netscape.com or mozilla.org. If you use local host names without the domain name, list them the same way. Use commas to separate multiple hostnames. The wildcard character [*] cannot be used.</p>
