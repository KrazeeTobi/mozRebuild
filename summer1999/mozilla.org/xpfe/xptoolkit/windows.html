      <h2>Scope</h2>
      <p>This document is not intended to be a comprehensive syntax or reference 
        manual. With care and time, it should grow into a useful starting place 
        for making windows and writing dialogs. The <a href="mailto:danm@netscape.com">author</a> 
        thinks that feedback on what's missing from the document would help build 
        a better document, so the quality of this thing is in the reader's hands. 
        Keep that in mind while you're cursing me.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, this document also serves as a roadmap of XPFE's dialog 
        story. Interested parties would please review it to determine whether 
        the package we plan to deliver will meet their needs.</p>
      <h2>Direction</h2>
      <p>Current XPFE design goals state that dialogs get no special treatment; 
        they're just windows like any other. Windows can have parent windows, 
        and be displayed modally, and have control callbacks, and so behave like 
        dialogs. But our goal is that the same application code that instantiates 
        a browser window will serve equally to instantiate a dialog window. The 
        difference lies in the window content, and a couple of parameters controlling 
        modality and that sort of thing.</p>
      <h2>JavaScript vs C++</h2>
      <p>Currently, all window control mechanisms flow through JavaScript. That 
        is, any capabilities a window may have besides taking up space on the 
        desktop are specified in the XUL describing the window, and the binding 
        between the window content and the application is done through JavaScript 
        in the XUL. That binding can be very short: it can fall through to application 
        C code very quickly, but JavaScript will be part of the process. (Note 
        that we have not yet run into any threading problems with this model, 
        but we kind of expect to.)</p>
      <p>JavaScript is easily added to a window: just include it in the XUL window 
        description and follow a short but peculiar dance to hook it up. Hooking 
        up C code involves writing a C++/JavaScript interface, and calling it 
        from JavaScript. Currently, for historical reasons, there is an unfortunate 
        dual standard for building these interfaces: DOM IDL and <a href="../../scriptable/">XPConnect</a>. 
        Though <a href="../appCore/appcores.html">AppCores</a> are currently built 
        using the former, XPConnect is the preferred means for writing additional 
        extensions.</p>
      <h2>Make a Window</h2>
      <p>So, there are two ways to make a window or dialog: directly through C++ 
        and from JavaScript. The resulting window is an instance of <code>nsWebShellWindow</code>. 
        This means it currently contains a hulking bunch of hackery for hooking 
        up browser-window specific contents. This causes no harm, and will be 
        cleaned up in the future.</p>
      <p>Note that modal dialogs or alerts are currently working only on Windows 
        and the Macintosh, and even then, only for modal dialogs created on the 
        UI thread. That is to say, they're only halfway there. Also note that 
        windows are not sized to content. These are merely somewhat glorified 
        browser windows, to which automatically sizing themselves to match their 
        content is something of an eyebrow-furrowing concept. Specifying the size 
        of a dialog is another future enhancement.</p>
      <h3>JavaScript</h3>
      <p><code>window.open</code> will open a XUL window if given a XUL URL to 
        load. It will open the given URL as the contents of a browser window, 
        unless the <code>chrome</code> feature is specified in <code>window.open</code>'s 
        third (&quot;features&quot;) parameter. Mozilla supports an extended form 
        of <code>window.open</code> which can be used to pass parameters back 
        and forth to the dialog window. It's named <code>window.openDialog</code>, 
        reasonably enough, for now. Both <code>window.openDialog</code> and <code>chrome</code> 
        are described in <a href="#jsextensions">JavaScript Extensions</a>.</p>
      <p>Another JavaScript interface is a Mozilla AppCore named <code>ToolkitCore</code>. 
        It contains a handful of windowing utility functions which were more useful 
        before <code>window.open</code> was working properly. <code>ToolkitCore</code> 
        will probably be deprecated soon.</p>
      <pre><code>
 function MakeDialog() {
   var newWindow = window.open(&quot;resource://res/samples/madedialog.xul&quot;,
                     &quot;itsname&quot;, &quot;chrome&quot;);
 }</code></pre>
      or, alternatively for now, 
      <pre><code>
 function MakeDialog() {
    var toolkitCore = XPAppCoresManager.Find("ToolkitCore");
    if (!toolkitCore) {
      toolkitCore = new ToolkitCore();
      if (toolkitCore)
        toolkitCore.Init("ToolkitCore");
    }
    if (toolkitCore)
      toolkitCore.ShowWindow("resource://res/samples/madedialog.xul",
          window);
  }</code></pre>
      <p>An <code>XPAppCoresManager</code> is pre-constructed; you can access 
        it without any more preparation than shown above. <code>ToolkitCore</code> 
        is not; it requires that small bit of preparation.</p>
      <h3>C++</h3>
      There are two interfaces for opening new windows from C code. They are equivalent 
      in the sense that either will make a new window, and both share their innermost 
      important bits. The reason for having both is part historical, and part 
      momentum. In the future, we'd like to meld the two into one. 
      <h4>nsIAppShellService::CreateTopLevelWindow</h4>
      <p>The primary C++ interface is <code>nsIAppShellService::CreateTopLevelWindow()</code>. 
        It's currently very clunky and will change (you'll see that statement 
        many times in this document). But at time of writing, you create a new 
        window like this:</p>
      <pre><code>
  nsresult              rv;
  nsIAppShellService    *appShell;
  nsIURL                *url;
  nsIWebShellWindow     *parent, *window;
  nsIStreamObserver     *observer;
  nsIXULWindowCallbacks *callbacks;
  PRInt32               width, height;

  window = nsnull;
  rv = nsServiceManager::GetService(kAppShellServiceCID,
         kIAppShellServiceIID,
         (nsISupports**) &appShell);
  if (NS_SUCCEEDED(rv)) {
    appShell->CreateTopLevelWindow(parent, url, PR_TRUE,
                window, observer, callbacks, width, height);
    nsServiceManager::ReleaseService(kAppShellServiceCID,
                appShell);
  }</code></pre>
      <p>At time of writing, only <code>url</code>, <code>showWindow</code>, <code>window</code>, 
        <code>aInitialWidth</code> and <code>aInitialHeight</code> are actually 
        used. <code>url</code> is an URL describing the contents of the window. 
        <code>window</code> is returned from the function, set to the created 
        window. See the code for descriptions of the other parameters. This interface 
        is a little rife with silly parameters, and is slowly being cleaned up.</p>
      <p>There is another very similar method <code>nsIAppShellService::CreateDialogWindow()</code>. 
        It takes the same parameters and currently functions exactly the same. 
        These two methods are planned to differ only in the kind of border used 
        on the window created. At time of writing, this decision is made at the 
        time the window is created, before any instructions in the file behind 
        the URL could be read and used to help make the decision.</p>
      <p>At this time, window descriptions must be loaded from an URL. There will 
        additionally be methods for loading windows from a stream. In fact, XPFE 
        want to say the stream will be the preferred method, though the URL method 
        will probably remain. Streams will disengage the toolkit further from 
        the source of the window description, and will be our method for creating 
        windows whose XUL is calculated at runtime, rather than being distributed 
        as a file.</p>
      <h4>nsIDOMWindow::OpenDialog</h4>
      <p>The other C++ interface is <code>nsIDOMWindow::OpenDialog</code>. It 
        has the advantage that it behaves exactly like the JavaScript <code>window.openDialog</code> 
        function, being the same code used by that function, after all.</p>
      <p>The close association between this function and JavaScript places constraints 
        on its usage. Any parameters sent to this function must be ready for use 
        in JavaScript handlers built into the new window, and so must be fitted 
        into JavaScript wrappers. There must also be a &quot;parent&quot; window 
        available to do the window opening and provide a JavaScript context.</p>
      <p>The function to wrap a series of arguments is called <code>JS_PushArguments</code>, 
        and is defined in <code>jsapi.h</code>. Its mysterious third argument 
        is explained in that same header file. The sample code below will call 
        <code>OpenDialog</code>, given an <code>nsIDOMWindow</code> to work with. 
        The arguments to <code>OpenDialog</code> are exactly those from its JavaScript 
        definition, explained in <a href="#jsextensions">JavaScript Extensions</a>. 
        The first three are standard <code>Open</code> arguments. The remainder 
        are parameters for the new window. That new window will have a property 
        named <code>arguments</code>. It's an array, and <code>arguments[0]</code> 
        is the string &quot;I was born a C string&quot;, while <code>arguments[1]</code> 
        is the number 298. </p>
      <pre><code>DoOpenDialog(nsIDOMWindow* aParent) {

  if (!aParent)
    return NS_ERROR_NULL_POINTER;

  nsresult rv = NS_ERROR_FAILURE;
  JSContext *jscx = 0;
  nsIDOMWindow *newWindow;

  // get the parent window's JS Context (this is not really a blessed thing
  // to do, but I believe it's all we have. it wants to be a real interface
  // someday.)
  nsCOMPtr&lt;nsIScriptGlobalObject&gt; scriptGlobalObj = do_QueryInterface(aParent);
  if (scriptGlobalObj) {
    nsCOMPtr&lt;nsIScriptContext&gt; scriptcx;
    scriptGlobalObj-&gt;GetContext(getter_AddRefs(scriptcx));
    if (scriptcx)
      jscx = (JSContext *) scriptcx-&gt;GetNativeContext();
  }

  // if everything went as planned...
  if (jscx) {

    // build a JavaScript &quot;arguments&quot; array for the OpenDialog function
    void *mark;
    jsval *argv;

    argv = JS_PushArguments(jscx, &amp;mark, &quot;ssssu&quot;,
      &quot;resource://res/samples/paramdialog.xul&quot;,
      &quot;windowName&quot;,
      &quot;chrome&quot;,
      &quot;I was born a C string&quot;,
      (uint32) 298);

    // if that worked, call the function.
    if (argv) {
      aParent-&gt;OpenDialog(jscx, argv, 5, &amp;newWindow);
      JS_PopArguments(jscx, mark);
      rv = NS_OK;
    }
  }

  return rv;
}</code></pre>
      <h2>Load a Window</h2>
      <p>Between making and showing the window, there is a callback. The resulting 
        <code>nsWebShellWindow</code> comes with an associated DOM content model. 
        Any initial control settings or content changes which must be made before 
        the window is actually shown can be done at the time of this callback.</p>
      <p>This callback is any JavaScript specified as the value of the <code>onload</code> 
        attribute of the <code>&lt;window&gt;</code> element. In the example below, 
        the window start tag is declared</p>
      <code>&lt;window ... onload=&quot;Startup()&quot;&gt;</code> 
      <p>During the <code>onload</code> callback, dialog authors are free to alter 
        control settings from JavaScript:</p>
      <pre><code>
  function Startup() {
    // yellowize and check the "ow" button
    document.bgColor = "yellow";
    var checkbox = document.getElementByID("ow");
    if (checkbox)
      checkbox.checked = true;
  }</code></pre>
      <p>Except that not all properties are hooked up yet. The change to background 
        color in the example won't do anything. But the important example does 
        work!</p>
      <p>Dialog preprocessing can also be done in C by defining an AppCore, loading 
        and calling it from the <code>Startup()</code> method, as the <code>ToolkitCore</code> 
        AppCore was called to create the window.</p>
      <h2>Debrief a Window</h2>
      <p>After the dialog has run -- a dismissal button has been clicked, say 
        -- dialog users will need a callback in which to query the current control 
        settings. As always, this will be done by walking the DOM content model, 
        and accessed through a JavaScript hook.</p>
      <p>We are uncertain whether a specific callback need be added: the event 
        handler for the dismissal buttons may be entirely sufficient. But as the 
        reader has no doubt guessed, there is no specific debriefing hook implemented 
        at this time.</p>
      <p>Data can be passed back to the calling window in more than one way. The 
        dialog window and opener can agree to share information as properties 
        added to the JavaScript dialog window object. Alternatively, the two windows 
        could agree that the dialog window will call some function of its opener. 
        A third way could be for the opener to use <code>window.openDialog</code> 
        to pass parameters by reference to the dialog window. Any changes made 
        by the dialog to these parameters would be visible in the opener window. 
        See <a href="#jsextensions">JavaScript Extensions</a> or the <a href="#examples">examples</a> 
        for details. Two files in the source code at <code>mozilla/xpfe/browser/samples/dexparam*.xul</code> 
        are a kind of test suite for parameter passing, and consequently spell 
        out more details than will this document.</p>
      <p>Note at time of writing, a dialog window, once closed, cannot be successfully 
        accessed from JavaScript through the variable which was returned by <code>window.open</code>. 
        This is a known bug, and wants fixing.</p>
      <h2><a name="jsextensions"></a>JavaScript Extensions</h2>
      <p>Mozilla has found it necessary to support a few extensions to standard 
        JavaScript. These are, well, nonstandard. They are therefore subject to 
        change while the program is under development, and will not work with 
        other browser applications. Extensions used by the windowing system are 
        described below. Other systems' extensions are described in their respective 
        documents. </p>
      <h3>window.open</h3>
      <p><code>open(URL[, windowName [, windowFeatures]])</code></p>
      <p>The standard syntax still applies. See a JavaScript reference for details. 
        Mozilla, however, understands a few extensions to <code>windowFeatures</code> 
        (and doesn't yet understand all the latest standard features). The treatment 
        of these extensions is somewhat confused in the name of backward compatibility 
        and because of the sometimes uneasy interplay between standards-compliant 
        <code>open</code> and the more freewheeling <code>openDialog</code>.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>New Features 
          <ul>
            <li><code>titlebar</code> - The window can be created with or without 
              a titlebar.</li>
            <li><code>close</code> - The window can be created with or without 
              a close widget.</li>
            <li><code>chrome</code> - Normally, the URL given to <code>window.open</code> 
              is treated as a content URL. That is, Mozilla generates a browser 
              window and loads the given URL into its content area, as <code>window.open</code> 
              has always behaved. However, the presence of a <code>chrome</code> 
              flag in the <code>windowFeatures</code> parameter will cause the 
              given URL to be treated as the window chrome, itself. It will be 
              treated as the top-level window contents; it will not be wrapped 
              in a browser window. The window will also be sized to wrap its contents.</li>
            <li><code>dependent</code> - The new window belongs to the calling 
              window, on operating systems that support this behaviour. This is 
              the kind of window that is minimized along with its parent/owner; 
              a &quot;popup&quot; or &quot;transient&quot; window, or whatever 
              word your OS has chosen to use.</li>
            <li><code>dialog</code> - Use a dialog-style window border.</li>
            <li><code>modal</code> - The window will be run modally. The call 
              to <code>window.open</code> will not return until the user has dismissed 
              the window. Note that <code>modal</code> implies <code>dependent</code>.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Misunderstood Features 
          <ul>
            <li>The following features are not implemented at time of writing: 
              all z-ordering features (<code>alwaysLowered</code>, <code>alwaysRaised</code>, 
              <code>z-lock</code>), <code>as well as copyhistory</code>, <code>hotkeys</code>, 
              <code>screenX</code>, <code>screenY</code>, and <code>scrollbars</code>.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Default Behaviour - As always, if no parameter is passed, all chrome 
          is assumed turned on. Exceptions are the behaviour flags <code>chrome</code>, 
          <code>dependent</code>, <code>dialog</code> and <code>modal</code>: 
          these are not turned on unless done explicitly. If any string at all, 
          even a zero-length string, is given in the <code>features</code> parameter, 
          any features not explicitly mentioned are assumed off. <code>titlebar</code> 
          and <code>close</code> are the two exceptions: they are not considered 
          off unless explicitly mentioned (&quot;<code>titlebar=no</code>&quot;), 
          since anything else would break extant script.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>window.openDialog</h3>
      <p><code>openDialog(URL[, windowName [, windowFeatures [, args]]])</code></p>
      <p><code>window.openDialog</code> is an extension to <code>window.open</code>. 
        It behaves the same, except that it can optionally take one or more parameters 
        past <code>windowFeatures</code>, and <code>windowFeatures</code> itself 
        is treated a little differently.</p>
      <p>The optional parameters, if present, will be bundled up in a JavaScript 
        array and added to the newly created window as a property named <code>arguments</code>. 
        They may be referenced in the JavaScript of the window at any time, including 
        during the execution of an <code>onload</code> handler. These parameters 
        may be used, then, to pass arguments to and from the dialog window.</p>
      <p>A dialog summoned up</p>
      <p> <code>openDialog(&quot;http://zzz.xul&quot;, &quot;dlg&quot;, &quot;&quot;, 
        &quot;pizza&quot;, 6.98)</code></p>
      <p>could reference the &quot;pizza&quot; string as <code>window.arguments[0]</code>, 
        and the number as <code>window.arguments[1]</code>.</p>
      <p><code>openDialog</code> treats the <code>features</code> parameter exactly 
        as does <code>open</code>, with the following differences.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>New Features 
          <ul>
            <li><code>all</code> - Initially activates (or deactivates (&quot;<code>all=no</code>&quot;)) 
              all chrome (except the behaviour flags <code>chrome</code>, <code>dialog</code> 
              and <code>modal</code>). These can be overridden (so &quot;<code>menubar=no,all</code>&quot; 
              turns on all chrome except the menubar.) This feature is explicitly 
              ignored by <code>window.open</code>. <code>window.openDialog</code> 
              finds it useful because of its different default assumptions.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Default behaviour - The <code>chrome</code> and <code>dialog</code> 
          features are always assumed on, unless explicitly turned off (&quot;<code>chrome=no</code>&quot;). 
          <code>openDialog</code> treats the absence of the features parameter 
          as does <code>window.open</code>, (that is, an empty string sets all 
          features to off) except <code>chrome</code> and <code>dialog</code>, 
          which default to on. If the <code>features</code> parameter is a zero-length 
          string, or contains only one or more of the behaviour features (<code>chrome</code>, 
          <code>dependent</code>, <code>dialog</code> and <code>modal</code>) the chrome features 
          are assumed &quot;OS' choice.&quot; That is, window creation code is 
          not given specific instructions, but is instead allowed to select the 
          chrome that best fits a dialog on that operating system.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>window.content</h3>
      <p>Standard JavaScript assumes a standard browser window built on immutable 
        contents: a menubar, a set of toolbars, and the point of this feature, 
        a single HTML content area. Windows described by XUL can have any or none 
        of any of these things. If the window is to include &quot;content,&quot; 
        that is, a self-contained rectangle capable of displaying the contents 
        of an arbitrary URL, then it must contain one (or more) content area. 
        An example of a window that includes a content area is a browser window. 
        An example of a window that does not is a simple dialog.</p>
      <p>Content areas are embedded in the window UI using an <code>iframe</code>. 
        (The best documentation on this is, unfortunately, the XUL files in the 
        Mozilla source.) An <code>iframe</code> corresponds to a JavaScript <code>window</code> 
        object. Note that the window UI (or chrome) is itself (XUL) content, described 
        by a URL. It corresponds to a <code>window</code> object, as well. A content 
        area is, once again, a container for URLs within URLs.</p>
      <p>JavaScript code wishing to refer to the main content area of a window 
        can simply use the window's <code>content</code> property. A bookmark 
        in another iframe or a menu item, for instance, for navigating to mozilla.org 
        could be implemented using JavaScript reading</p>
      <p><code>window.content.location.href = &quot;http://www.mozilla.org/&quot;</code></p>
      <p><code>window.content</code> is merely a shortcut for finding whatever 
        was described in the XUL file as being the window's primary content area. 
        That description is accomplished using the <code>iframe</code>'s <code>type</code> 
        attribute. Mozilla makes note of all <code>iframe</code>s with a <code>type</code> 
        of <code>content</code>. At this time, they just exchange insurance information 
        and carry on; little is done with content frames. However, the <code>window.content</code> 
        property returns the particular JavaScript <code>window</code> corresponding 
        to the <code>iframe</code> with a <code>type</code> of <code>content-primary</code>. 
        So for this shortcut to work, there must be an <code>iframe</code> declared</p>
      <p><code>&lt;iframe type=&quot;content-primary&quot; .../&gt;</code></p>
      <p>somewhere in the window description. (Yes, a JavaScript <code>window</code> 
        can be either a real window or a content area. If you find this confusing, 
        a good JavaScript book may help.)</p>
      <p>The content area can also be referenced using the <code>target</code> 
        attribute of a link:</p>
      <p><code>&lt;a target=&quot;_content&quot; href=&quot;http://www.mozilla.org&quot;&gt;visit 
        Mozilla&lt;/a&gt;</code> </p>
      <h2><a name="examples"></a>Examples</h2>
      <p>The following XUL describes a browser window with a simple toolbar containing 
        a single button which will open another window: a nonmodal dialog, with 
        a bit of imagination. It uses the extended <code>window.open</code> syntax 
        to pass parameters to the dialog window. The dialog window uses these 
        parameters to initialize its settings. It then passes the state of its 
        checkbox back to the caller, in that same parameter.</p>

      <p>Note that only html widgets will have the expected html-specific DOM 
        attributes like &quot;checked&quot; for checkboxes. XUL buttons will respond 
        to their own APIs (to be documented in separate, dedicated papers), as 
        well as to the core DOM interfaces. Generally, as in <code>titledbutton</code> 
        above, attribute names match their HTML counterparts. But see specific 
        widget documentation to be certain.</p>
      <p>The above code will produce a live window with a functional button if 
        placed in a file named, perhaps, <code>makedialog.xul</code> in the <code>res/samples</code> 
        subdirectory within the directory containing <code>apprunner</code>. (Placing 
        it in that directory allows it to find the stylesheet <code>xul.css</code> 
        mentioned in the stylesheet processing instruction.) Launch <code>apprunner</code> 
        pointing at that URL to load it into the main window.</p>
      <p><code>apprunner -url resource:/res/samples/makedialog.xul</code></p>
      <p>A suitable dialog description XUL file (named <code>madedialog.xul</code> 
        in the above code) will be loaded when the <code>Make Dialog</code> button 
        is pressed. The following example contains initialization code as mentioned 
        in this document.</p>
      <p>The authors have turned a jaundiced eye toward any sense of aesthetics 
        in the design of this dialog. It's ugly. It will show up directly on top 
        of the main &quot;browser&quot; window. I plan to rely on the estimable 
        work of a colleague to provide some documentation for what sorts of visual 
        effects can be accomplished with dialog controls and provide a link to 
        a separate document with prettier samples.</p>
