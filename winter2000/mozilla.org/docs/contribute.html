<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>contribute documentation</H1>
Open documentation is as important to the success of Mozilla as 
open source.  Mozilla documentation therefore should be freely 
distributable, modifiable, and open for use by anyone, including
commercial entities.  To quote Richard Stallman in
<A HREF="http://www.fsf.org/philosophy/free-doc.html">
<I>Free Software And Free Manuals</I></A>:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The criterion for a free manual is pretty much the same as for free software: 
it is a matter of giving all users certain freedoms. Redistribution (including 
commercial redistribution) must be permitted, so that the manual can accompany
every copy of the program, on-line or on paper. Permission for modification is
crucial too. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

We hope that if you're interested in Mozilla's open source code that you'll
also be interested in helping maintain its documentation.  Documentation is 
needed for nearly every aspect of Mozilla. 
To discuss Mozilla documentation, visit our 
<A HREF="news://news.mozilla.org/netscape.public.mozilla.documentation">
documentation newsgroup</A>.

<P>
<B>The Document Review Process</B>
<P>
We would like to create a framework for documentation where contributors
can add documents, get peer review, organize and maintain documents.  
Some contributors will be primarily developers who are documenting 
the code they work with. Others will be primarily wordsmiths. We hope
to get these people working together.  If your inital document is 
unpolished ask for help filling in technical details or polishing the 
language.
<P>
We also want to keep track of document status.
Is the document complete or does it need some holes filled in?  Is it 
complete but in need of editing?  Is it finished and polished?
Do parts of it need to be updated because of changes in the code?
Should the document be retired because the code it describes was retired?
<P>
To facilitate the review process we have created a Documentation product in 
<A HREF="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/">Bugzilla</A>. Use this to keep 
track of problems with documents and to submit new documents for review.
Bugzilla divides our documentation into three categories.
<OL>
<LI>
<B>Mozilla developers</B> - These documents are probably only useful for 
people who compile mozilla.  It includes user manuals for code modules like 
<A HREF="../projects/xpcom/nsCOMPtr.html">
<I>The Complete</I> <CODE>nsCOMPtr</CODE> <I>User's Manual</I>
</A> as well as documenting API's with javadoc and 
<A HREF="lxr-comments.html"><I>Commenting Mozilla for LXR</I></A>
to make LXR print descriptions in its file listings. We especially need
bird's-eye overviews of the code for first-time Mozilla hackers.
<P> <LI>
<B>Web Developers</B> - This category overlaps the other two categories 
but should generally contain information useful to content creators, 
web site administrators, system administrators and people using Mozilla 
as an application development platform. XUL documentation goes here 
because even though it's needed by Mozilla developers, it's useful 
to others as well.

<P> <LI>
<B>Users</B> - Documentation reachable from Mozilla's <I>Help</I> menu.
</OL>
<P>

<P>
<B>Getting Involved</B>
<P>
Here are some ways to help.
<UL>
<LI>
If you just spent some time trying to figure out how part of Mozilla works,
write down what you figured out. Others will probably have the same
questions that you did. It doesn't have to be fancy. Post your findings to
a newsgroup and get some feedback. If someone hasn't already come forward,
post to the documentation newsgroup and ask for help htmlifying and 
polishing.
<LI>
When you contribute code, document it. Even if you don't have time to 
generate something fully polished, submit a draft and look for a
volunteer in the documentation newsgroup to help polish it up. 
<LI> 
To get help, post to the documentation newsgroup. If no one offers
to help right away, create a documentation enhancement request
in bugzilla and mark it HELP WANTED.
<LI>
Search the newsgroups for pearls of wisdom.  Sometimes you might 
find an explanation that should be added to an existing document
or to the <A HREF="jargon.html">jargon list</A>. If you notice
the same questions being asked repeatedly, get them added to the
<A HREF="../faq.html">FAQ</A>. 
Often you'll find drafts that people posted but which never made 
their way to the web site. Offer to help the author polish the posting 
and check it in to the web site.
<LI>
Search Bugzilla for documentation bugs marked HELP WANTED in the 
Status Whiteboard field.
</UL>

<P>
<B>Style Guide</B>
<P>
Use our <A HREF="../README-style.html"><I>Style Guide</I></A>
for guidance on creating content for our site. Our goal is to create 
content that works with a wide variety of browsers, even old, lame ones.
We can't assume that people are using Mozilla to read our web site.
In fact, many people read our site precisely because they can't yet use
Mozilla. Keep the format of your documents as vanilla as possible.
Feel free to write demo files to illustrate Mozilla's whizzy features,
but make sure your document's main content is readable by everyone.
In particular, use GIF images instead of PNG.  Use HTML, not XML.
Don't require the use of JavaScript except for demos since many hackers
leave JavaScript turned off.

<P>
<B>Checking In Documents</B>
<P>

We are working on a copyright policy.  In the future, we hope to 
institute a copyright policy that encourages information sharing, 
possibly like the 
<A HREF="http://www.opencontent.org/openpub/">Open Publication Licence</A>
or the 
<A HREF="http://sunsite.unc.edu/mdw/LDP-COPYRIGHT.html"> Linux
Documentation Project</A> in which authors retain their own copyright
while extending blanket reproduction and distribution privileges
(subject to certain conditions). 

We are interested in hearing your opinions about this issue. 
Please post them to our 
<A HREF="news://news.mozilla.org/netscape.public.mozilla.documentation">
documentation</A> newsgroup.
<P>
We use CVS to manage the documents on our web site and use the
same mechanism to grant access to the document tree as to the source tree. 
If you're submitting changes to a current document, check out the document
via anonymous cvs. 
(Not set up yet. See bug 
<A HREF="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=20962">20962</A>)
Use <CODE>cvs diff -u</CODE> 
to make a patch file and submit the file to the owner of the document.
If the document doesn't list its owner, click on the Last Modified link 
at the bottom of the page to see who has recently updated the page 
and ask them.  If all else fails, mail
<A HREF="mailto:webmaster@mozilla.org">webmaster@mozilla.org</A>.
<P>
As with the source code, if you establish a track record of good work
then you may be granted access to the repository, especially if you
contribute documents and become their official owner and maintainer.
To get access, you'll need to submit a 
<A HREF="../hacking/form.html">CVS Contributor Form</A>. Read 
<A HREF="../README-cvs.html"><I>mozilla.org Content And CVS</I></A>
for CVS information specific to our doc tree. The document
<A HREF="../cvs.html"><I>Source Code Via CVS</I></A> explains where to
get a CVS client for your platform and has pointers to CVS documentation.
