NSPR 2.0: Process forking</H2>
The threads provided in NSPR 2.0 are implemented using different mechanisms
on the various platforms. On some platforms, nspr threads directly map
one-to-one to the threads provided by the platform vendor, on other platforms
nspr threads are basically user-level threads within a single process (with
no kernel threads) and on still others nspr threads are user-level threads
implemented on top of one or more kernel threads within single address
space.

<P>NSPR 2.0 does not override the fork function and so, when fork is called
from the nspr thread the results are different on the various platforms.
All the threads  present in the parent process may be replicated in
the child process, only the calling thread may be replicated in the child
process or only the calling kernel thread may be replicated.

<P>So, to be consistent across all platforms, it is suggested that when
using fork in a nspr thread;

<P>1. The exec function should be called in the child process.
<BR>2. No nspr functions should be called in the child process before the
exec call is made.
