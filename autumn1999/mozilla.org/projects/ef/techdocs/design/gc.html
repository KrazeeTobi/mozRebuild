<H2>1. Introduction</H2>

The Sport Model garbage collector was designed to support the memory management
requirements of the Java language. Sport Model is packaged as a library
with a C-language API that supports a wide range of garbage collection
and memory management needs, and is more widely applicable than to just
Java virtual machine implementations. This paper describes Sport Model's
design and implementation, and illustrates how it can be integrated into
C and C++ applications.

<P>In garbage collector parlance, Sport Model can be described as a hybrid
generational, mark and deferred sweep, mostly copying garbage collector
with an integrated malloc/free system. However it goes farther than that
in that numerous subtle and interacting details factor into a coherent
and efficient system. The design goals of Sport Model, simply stated, are:
<UL>
<LI>
to support the features required by Java,

<LI>
minimize garbage collection pause times,

<LI>
minimize object allocation time,

<LI>
minimize heap size,

<LI>
interoperability with native code (JIT) compilers,

<LI>
interoperability with C and C++,

<LI>
debuggability of client programs, and

<LI>
portability.
</UL>
Each of these will be discussed in detail in the next section, along with
the supporting rationale.
<H2>2. Design</H2>


<H3>2.1 Features required by Java</H3>

The Java language requires features to be supported by the garbage collector
that go beyond the basic automatic reclamation of objects:

<P><B>Circular references</B>: The Java language requires all objects not
reachable from a set of VM roots to be automatically freed. Some garbage
collection schemes, notably reference counting, cannot reclaim circular
chains of otherwise unreferenced objects. We can rule out this class of
garbage collection algorithms.

<P><B>Finalization</B>: An object's <TT>finalize</TT> method must be run
whenever no more references to the object can be found, but before the
object's memory is freed. In addition to basic object finalization, the
Java VM requires the ability to finalize all remaining finalizable objects
on system shut-down.

<P><B>Weak references</B>: The <TT>sun.misc.WeakRef</TT> class requires
weak reference support. <I>Weak references</I> are like normal references
to objects, except they do not factor into liveness considerations. If
no other reference to an object can be found except a weak reference, the
Java language requires the weak reference to be set to <TT>null</TT>. Weak
references are useful in implementing caches.

<P><B>Support for JNI</B>: The Java Native Method Interface (JNI) allows
for code written in C and C++ to interact with the Java VM. JNI specifies
that all <I>local</I> object references given out to native code and held
on the C runtime stack must be retained and not garbage collected. This
may be implemented by either employing a <I>conservative</I> garbage collection
technique, retaining any objects that are potentially referred to by ambiguous
stack references, or by introducing a level of indirection between local
references and the objects to which they refer.

<P>Although conservative garbage collection is not strictly required by
JNI, the way in which array elements are manipulated also factors into
whether it is an appropriate implementation technique. The <TT>GetArrayElements</TT>
operation must be called to obtain a native vector of elements, and the
<TT>ReleaseArrayElements</TT>
operation must be called when the native code is done manipulating the
contents. One of two implementation strategies may be used for these operations:
<OL>
<LI>
Return a direct pointer to the array's contents. This requires the object
to not relocate in memory throughout the duration of its manipulation.
If a copying collection strategy is used, the object must be <I>pinned</I>
(forced to not be copied or otherwised moved). Also this requires the object
to remain live even if the only reference to it is the native code's pointer
to the array's interior.

<LI>
Make a copy of the array's contents, and commit changes made to the copy
when released. Although commiting the copy can become troublesome if multiple
threads are involved, the main drawback of this strategy is that memory
must be available for potentially large copies of arrays, and the time
spent making the copy and then copying it back can become prohibitive.
</OL>
These JNI considerations caused the first major design decision for Sport
Model -- that it should support conservative collection. By supporting
conservative collection, copies of array contents need not be made. Also,
conservative collection simplifies the JNI logic which would otherwise
have to keep track of which object references were currently in use by
native code. Direct pointers to objects can be given out to native code
provided that the native code doesn't store them directly in the heap (a
requirement of JNI).

<P>If copying collection is employed, the garbage collector would need
the ability to pin array objects when their contents are given out to native
code. Sport Model does indeed support copying (for reasons described below)
and consequently it also supports pinning.

<P><B>Per-object hash-codes and monitors</B>: Java requires all objects
to support <I>hash-codes</I> (per-object unique IDs used for hashing purposes)
and to support monitor operations. These can be supported by storage extrinsic
to the object (e.g. a monitor cache) or by allocating fields for them within
the object itself.

<P>Adding fields to every object for these seldom-used operations can be
very costly in terms of space. Data was taken in Communicator while visiting
numerous pages containing applets, and the following graph of numbers of
objects distributed by size was produced:
<CENTER>
    <IMG SRC="graphics/Sizes.gif" ALT="Object Size Distribution" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=360 WIDTH=636>
</CENTER>

<P>From this graph we can see that most objects are small, and the percentage
cost of per-object fields is high (moreover, this graph shows skewed results
due to the 2 word (8 bytes on a 32-bit machine) object-handle overhead
used by our current VM). A <A HREF="http://warp/java/ElectricalFire/design/monitors.html">clever
design</A> by the Electrical Fire team can reduce both the monitor and
hash-code overhead to a single word per object. Nevertheless, this can
be all be handled external to the garbage collector and is therefore not
dealt with directly by Sport Model.
<H3>2.2 Minimizing garbage collection pause times</H3>

Reducing the pause time incurred by garbage collection was the number one
goal after supporting the Java language. Although pause time hasn't been
a significant problem in the interactive client (applet) environment, it
is a particular problem for the web server environment where it is critical
that we not pause all threads while some particular thread forces a garbage
collection.
<H4>Generation scavenging</H4>

The following graphs illustrate data accumulated during the same run of
Communicator as the previous graph and show the accumulated lifetimes of
objects broken out by size. Units of lifetime are in number of collections
-- a collection was forced after every object allocation:
<CENTER>
  <IMG SRC="graphics/Lifetimes.gif" ALT="Object Lifetime Distribution" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=397 WIDTH=637> 
  <BR>
  <IMG SRC="graphics/LifetimesCloseup.gif" ALT="Object Lifetime Distribution (closeup)" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=373 WIDTH=637>
</CENTER>

<P>From these graphs we can see that a very large percentage of objects
become garbage almost immediately -- indeed before the next object is created.
This data supports the <I>generational hypothesis</I> which states that
the probability that an object will become garbage is inversely proportional
to the number of collections it has survived, i.e. that newly created objects
are highly likely to be temporary.

<P>A technique known as <I>generation scavenging</I> attempts to exploit
this statistic by partitioning the heap into a series of <I>generations</I>,
and promoting objects from generation to generation as they survive some
number of collections. This allows long-lived objects to be examined much
less frequently by the collector, minimizing the working set of objects
which must be examined by the collector, and thereby minimizing the amount
of time spent collecting. The organization of generations can be depicted
as follows:
<CENTER>
    <IMG SRC="graphics/Generations.gif" ALT="Generations" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=197 WIDTH=361>
</CENTER>
Sport Model uses a copying style generation scavenging technique to factor
long-lived objects from those newly created. Objects are <I>promoted</I>
by copying them into sub-heaps associated with a generation after they
have survived some number of collections. Since conservative scanning of
C runtime stacks is also performed, a <I>mostly-copying</I> technique is
used in which only those objects that are not referred to by ambiguous
roots may be copied.

<P>Although copying garbage collection is a simple and effective technique
for both partitioning the heap into sub-heaps, and maintaining the set
of visited objects which must be retained for a collection, it has the
negative effect of requiring additional heap space during the course of
a collection. The set of old objects must be retained until the copying
is complete as well as enough space for the newly made copies. Generation
scavenging minimizes this impact by usually focusing on a single generation,
but in the worse-case scenario as much as twice as much heap space is required.
Obviously this can fail for data-intensive applications running under low-memory
conditions.

<P>For Sport Model, the hybrid nature of its collector comes to the rescue
during these low-memory conditions. Objects which cannot be copied are
simply left in place and marked instead, just as are objects referred to
by conservative roots. This allows for near-100% memory utilization, modulo
fragmentation concerns which will be discussed below.
<H4>Object promotion</H4>

A key concern when using generation scavenging is the premature promotion
of objects. By requiring objects to survive some number of collections
before promoting them to the next generation, we can be assured of a lower-bound
on their lifetime, and have a good indication that examining them less
frequently will not lead to excessive amounts of garbage being retained
for long periods of time. One technique for measuring the number of survivals
is to actually place a counter in the object that is incremented for each
collection.

<P>When the counter exceeds some predetermined value, the object may be
promoted. However, this leads to additional storage in the object for the
counter, and is more expensive during the collection process. The counter
must be incremented and tested for each live object.

<P>Sport Model uses a low-overhead technique to determine when an object
should be promoted. Two versions of the collection algorithm are used:
a mark-and-sweep version that is performed most frequently, and a copying
version that is used far less frequently. The mark-and-sweep algorithm
has no concern for whether it is time to promote an object or not. It is
fast and low-overhead. After N uses of the mark-and-sweep algorithm, a
<I>copy
cycle</I> takes place. The copying algorithm is then used which will promote
some objects to the next generation.

<P>In order to not promote objects which were created just before the copying
algorithm is run, a bit is used in the object header to indicate that at
least one copying cycle has already transpired for the object. When it
is time to copy the object, if that bit is not set, it sets it and leaves
the object in place in the current generation. If the bit is set, the object
is copied and the bit is cleared in the copy in the new generation. This
ensures that the object has lived between N and 2N collections, a sufficient
criterion for promotion to the next generation. The parameter N may be
tuned dynamically by the system (although currently fixed at 4 for the
current implementation).
<H4>Level-two cache concerns</H4>

In addition to minimizing the cost associated with promoting an object,
use of the mark-and-sweep algorithm has excellent characteristics with
respect to minimizing level-two cache miss rates experienced during collection.
Mark-and-sweep far outperforms copying in this regard because it minimizes
the working set of pages which must be visited during the collection process
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.cs.colorado.edu/pub/cs/techreports/zorn/CU-CS-528-91.ps.Z">[Zorn
91]</A>. Copying requires both the old page to be read and updated with
a forwarding pointer as well as the page containing the new copy. In contrast,
mark-and-sweep only requires an object's mark-bit to be set.

<P>Sport Model is further optimized for level-two cache concerns in that
it stores all object headers together on pages wholly dedicated to object
headers, and minimizes them to one byte per object. Objects are associated
with their corresponding headers by calculating the index of an object
on its containing page (pages contain objects all of the same size). The
index is used to obtain the object header in the object header array associated
with a page descriptor for that page. Although the cost of looking up the
object header is greater than just accessing the first word of the object
as is done in most systems, it is relatively inexpensive as the division
is performed by a table-lookup algorithm, and saving occurs because of
the effects of increased locality of reference on the level-two cache.
<H4>Multiprocessor considerations</H4>

A primary concern in a multiprocessor environment is that garbage collection
not suspend all threads while a collection takes place, particularly those
threads that are not participating in computations involving garbage collected
objects. For a web server environment, hundreds of threads may be servicing
requests a given instance, while only a very small number are executing
Java code in response to a request.

<P>Although Sport Model currently makes no provision for multiprocessor
environments, it is possible with some minor rearchitecting to allow for
multiple youngest generation sub-heaps, one per processor. This would allow
Java threads assigned to different processors to allocate objects independently,
without sharing a global lock on the sub-heap, and allow the youngest generation
for each processor to be collected independently. Only when a copying collection
occurs (which is far less frequent) would a lock need to be obtained on
the globally shared second generation sub-heap.

    <IMG SRC="graphics/Multiprocessor.gif" ALT="Multiprocessor Organization" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=233 WIDTH=420>
</CENTER>

<P>One consideration with this sort of architecture is that additional
rules would come into play about passing pointers between threads running
on different processors. Because the write barrier works by recording modified
pages and then uses this information to search for older objects that point
to younger ones, modifications would have to be made to accommodate pointers
made between youngest generations associated with different processors.
This should be doable with only a minor additional penalty at garbage collection
time.

<P>This multiprocessor work has not been done due to lack of support for
multiple processors in the low-level thread runtime system (NSPR).
