Are you here because you have a problem with Netscape Communicator? If so, 
you're in the wrong place. Try visiting their
<A HREF="http://help.netscape.com/">technical support</A> site or 
use the Netscape 
<A HREF="http://help.netscape.com/forms/bug-client.html">bug reporting
form</A> instead.
</B>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
</CENTER>

<P>
Do you want to report a bug with one of our 
<A HREF="../binaries.html">milestone or nightly builds</A> 
or with a copy of mozilla that you compiled yourself?
<A HREF="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/">Bugzilla</A> is the place 
to submit bug reports for software distributed by mozilla.org.  
This page gives an overview of how bugzilla works.  Read the 
<A HREF="../quality/bug-writing-guidelines.html"> bug writing guidelines</A>
as well, for tips on how to write useful bug reports.

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER> What Is Bugzilla?</H2>
<A HREF="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/">
Bugzilla</A> is a database for bugs. It lets people report bugs and
assigns these bugs to the appropriate developers. Developers can use bugzilla 
to keep a to-do list as well as to prioritize, schedule and track dependencies.
<P>
Not all 'bugs' are bugs.
Some items in the database are known as <I>Enhancement Requests</I> or 
<I>Requests For Enhancement</I> (RFE for short). An RFE is a bug whose 
severity field is set 
to 'enhancement'.  People often say 'bug' when they mean 'item in bugzilla',
so RFEs often get wind up being called bugs.

Enter the tasks you're planning to work on as enhancement 
requests and bugzilla will help you track them and allow others 
to see what you plan to work on. If people can see your flight plan,
they can avoid duplicating your work and can possibly help out or offer
feedback.

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Anatomy Of A Bug</H2>
Bugs and RFEs are composed of many fields. Some of them are described here.

<DL>
<DT><B>Component</B>
<DD>
The mozilla application is composed of many different components such as
the networking library, javascript, and the layout engine.
Carefully read the 
<A HREF="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describecomponents.cgi">
component descriptions</A> if you're unsure of which component to
attribute your bug to. Some components are very similar. For example,
problems with table layout should be assigned to HTML Tables, not to Layout.
The component you choose determines which person bugzilla assigns the bug to.
<P>

<DT><B>Status Whiteboard</B>
<DD>
The Status Whiteboard is used for writing short notes. Sometimes these
are QA related, sometimes it's used for to store various
keywords. For instance, the 
<A HREF="../newlayout/bugathon.html">bugathon</A>
uses it to for noting when bugs have test cases. 
<P>
<DL><DT><B>HELP WANTED<DD></B>
Developers can use this field for posting HELP WANTED notices. Write
'HELP WANTED' in the Status Whiteboard field of one of your bugs or RFEs
and others searching for things to do will find it.  People interested 
in <A HREF="../get-involved.html"> getting involved</A> can search 
bugzilla for bugs and RFEs marked <I>HELP WANTED</I>. Maybe one of them 
will have the expertise and resources to help you with your problem. 
<P>
For instance, if your code 
has a bug on some platform which you don't have access to, or with some
language you don't know, try writing <I>HELP WANTED</I> in the 
status whiteboard. 

<P>
Or, as with any developer, you're probably swamped with bugs. Some of these
bugs will be lower priority than others.  Try marking bugs that you realize 
you won't be able to any time soon, <I>HELP WANTED</I>. Someone else with 
different priorities may see this and help you out.

<P>
When marking bugs (or RFEs) HELP WANTED, be sure to add a comment 
carefully explaining what work needs to be done, and how to do it,
if you know. The better you can explain the problem and its solution, 
the more likely it is that someone can provide a useful solution.
</DL>

<P>
<DT><B>Target Milestone</B>
<DD>
The seamonkey project uses target milesones to plan Mozilla's development 
process.  A <A HREF="../projects/seamonkey/milestones/"> milestone plan</A> 
enumerates when different features are expected to be
completed. If a bug is marked M8, it means work on the bug is expected 
to be completed by milestone 8. This field should only be set 
by the person responsible for the bug.
<P>

<DT><B>Dependency</B>
<DD>
If a bug can't be fixed until another bug is fixed, that's a dependency.
For any bug, you can list the bugs it depends on and bugs that depend 
on it. Bugzilla can display a dependency graphs which shows which
the bugs it depends on and are dependent dependent on it.
<P>

<DT><B>Attachment</B>
<DD>
Adding an attachment to a bug can be very useful. Test cases, screen
shots and <A HREF="../editor/logging/api-logging.html">editor logs</A>
all can help pinpoint the bug and help the developer reproduce it. If you
fix a bug, attach the patch to the bug. This is the preferred way to
keep track of patches since it makes it easier for others to find and
test. To make a patch, you need to generate a diff file containing
the differences between the file with your changes and the original
file in the repository. To generate a patch file enumerating changes
for all files in the current directory try
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>cvs diff -u &gt; mypatch.diff
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
To apply a patch, go to the
proper directory and 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>patch &lt; bugpatch.diff</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</DL>
<P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Life Cycle Of A Bug</H2>
When a bug is first reported it is assigned
to the default owner of the bug's component and buzilla emails them
with the bug report. At this time the developer will probably look
at the bug and either accept it or give it to someone else. If the 
bug remains new and inactive for more than a week, bugzilla nags the 
bug's owner with email until action is taken.  Whenever a bug is reassigned or
has its component changed, its status is set to NEW. The NEW status
means that the bug is newly added to a particular developer's plate,
not that the bug is newly reported.
<P>

Whenever you change a field in a bug its a good idea to add additional
comments to explain what you are doing and why. Make a note whenever
you do things like change the component, reassign the bug, create an 
attachment add a dependency or add someone to the CC list. Whenever
someone makes a change to the bug or adds a comment, they are added
to the CC list and the owner, reporter and the CC list are sent an
email showing the changes to the bug report.
<P>


When a bug is fixed it's marked <I>RESOLVED</I> and given one of the
following  resolutions. 

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<DL>
<DT>
<B> FIXED </B>
<DD>
A fix for this bug is checked into the tree and
tested. 
<DT>
<B>INVALID </B>
<DD>
The problem described is not a bug 
<DT>
<B>WONTFIX  </B>
<DD>
The problem described is a bug which will never
be fixed. 
<DT>
<B>LATER  </B>
<DD>
The problem described is a bug which will not be
fixed in this version of the product. 
<DT>
<B>REMIND  </B>
<DD>
The problem described is a bug which will
probably not be fixed in this version of the
product, but might still be. 
<DT>
<B>DUPLICATE  </B>
<DD>
The problem is a duplicate of an existing bug.
Marking a bug duplicate requires the bug# of the
duplicating bug and will at least put that bug
number in the description field. 
<DT>
<B>WORKSFORME  </B>
<DD>
All attempts at reproducing this bug were futile,
reading the code produces no clues as to why
this behavior would occur. If more information
appears later, please re-assign the bug, for now,
file it.  
</DL>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<A HREF="../quality/"> QA </A>
looks at resolved bugs and to make sure the appropriate action has been
taken. If they agreee, the bug is marked VERIFIED. Bugs remain in this state
until the product ships, at which time the bug is marked CLOSED.  Bugs may
come back to life by becoming REOPENED.

<P>
Be careful when changing the status of someone else's bugs. Instead
of making the change yourself, its usually best to make a note of your
proposed change as a comment and to let the bug's 
owner review this and make the change themselves. For instance, if you 
think one bug is a duplicate of another, make a note of it in the 
<I>Additional Comments</I> section. 

<P>
If you make a lot of useful comments to someone's bugs they may come 
to trust your judgement and ask you to go ahead and make the changes 
yourself, but unless they do, its best to be cautious and only make comments.
