		Some simple guidelines for building a supportable ownership model.

		<STRONG>Document Status:</STRONG> Draft; Public.
		More explanation needed.

<H2>If you made it, you own it.</H2>

<P>
	...naturally.
	If you create a temporary object,
		obviously it's up to you to destroy it.
	That's a sure sign of ownership.
	If you create an object with a longer lifespan,
		you will own it until you give ownership away.
</P>

<H3>All `factory' and `getter' functions produce owning pointers.</H3>

<P>
	Such a function is the perfect example of something that
		creates an object with a longer lifespan that itself,
		and gives away ownership (by producing a pointer that is already <SPAN class="source-code">AddRef</SPAN>ed) ---
		in this case, to the caller.
	This is terrific for factory functions,
		but can be problematic for mere getters.
	It's unfortunate if you just needed access to it for a moment.
	In the latter case, caching the pointer you got back makes you a de facto owner.
	This may not be appropriate; and it may be hard to remedy
		without knowing if the object in question was truly created in response to your query.
</P>


<H2>Needing it isn't, by itself, a valid reason for owning it.</H2>

<P>
	You don't own an object because <STRONG>you</STRONG> need <STRONG>it</STRONG>.
	In fact often you own it because <STRONG>it</STRONG> needs <STRONG>you</STRONG>.
</P>

<H2>If you own <STRONG>it</STRONG>, it shouldn't own <STRONG>you</STRONG>.</H2>

<P>
	Even transitively.
	Or put another way: the ownership graph for any system should be acyclic.
	Anytime there is a cycle of ownership,
		there is a situation that isn't automatically handled by destructors.
	Special code must be provided and called to break the cycle before the participants can be individually released.
</P>

<H2>You don't need to own it if it's lifetime is guaranteed to be longer than yours.</H2>

<P>
	As for instance, when it owns you.
</P>

<H2>Parents own their children (and not the reverse).</H2>

<P>
	Though parents may not <STRONG>need</STRONG> to own their children.
	For instance, a tree may own all the nodes that are in it.
	All the nodes in the tree point to each other with non-owning pointers.
	In the simplest scheme, however,
		parents point to their children with owning-pointers,
		children point back to their parents with non-owning-pointers.
</P>

<H2>Containers own the things they contain (and not the reverse).</H2>

<P>
</P>


<H2>Use <SPAN class="source-code">nsCOMPtr</SPAN>s to implement owning-pointers.</H2>

<P>
	It's explicit, efficient, and fairly bullet-proof.
	It's easier to write `getter's and `setter's; and you don't need to put anything in your destructor.
</P>
