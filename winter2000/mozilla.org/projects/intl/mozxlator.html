MozillaTranslator</h1></center>

<h2>
<a NAME="mozxlator_v3.1"></a>Version 3.1 (Feb. 21, 2000)</h2>
In this new release there are the possiblity to call up an edit Phrase
dialog with muli-line TextAreas for editing. To use the new feature:
<ol>
<li>
Open a view and select a Entry (equal a row)</li>

<li>
In the functions dialog choose "Edit Entry" and this will bring up the
dialog.</li>
</ol>
Other updates to the program:
<ul>
<li>
The program no longer inserts the localization note "no loc note" to every
Entry it add's should have a couple of kilobytes in the glossary file.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a NAME="mozxlator_v3"></a>Version 3 (Feb. 16, 2000)</h2>

<blockquote>
<h4>
Features</h4>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<ul>
<li>
Glossary files that support multiple locales, QA support , and localization
notes.</li>

<li>
Different views. In V2 there was only the chrome view of the entries and
you had to hunt entries down in their specific files. Now there is also
a "View untranslated entries" ,&nbsp; "view redundant entries" and a "view
entries with keep original flag set".</li>

<li>
Support for keeping the glossary in sync with the actual chrome, simply
select "Update glossary" and everything is done. new entries&nbsp;&nbsp;
added, modified entries corrected and old ones removed.</li>

<li>
Support for import and export of partial glossary files, that only contain
the translated text the QA status&amp;comment for a single locale.</li>

<li>
Only need to save the glossary at the end of a session.</li>
</ul>

<h4>
Licence</h4>
There has been a small change in the licence. While it is still under the
MPL, it has dual licenced under the PostCard-licence which goes:
<br>&nbsp;
<ul>"If you use this program, you are encuraged but not requireed to send
a snail mail postcard from your part of the world to the auther."</ul>

<p><br>This is merely for fun, but if you wanna play along email me for
the mailing address.
<h4>
System requirements:</h4>

<ul>
<li>
a Mozilla Installation nightly or MileStone</li>

<li>
a java 2 compliant JVM, on windows I recommend the Java 2 SDK 1.3 Release
Candiate (java.sun.com)</li>
</ul>

<h4>
Installation</h4>

<ul>
<li>
copy the jar file to the harddrive</li>

<li>
delete any files left from V2 (the properties files are not compatible)</li>

<li>
if you are running it on windows, you can download the Run.bat file,so
yopu don't have to use the command file</li>
</ul>

<h4>
Starting the program</h4>
Assuming windows here, other platform should only differ slightly)
<ul>
<li>
either use the run.bat file (if on windows); or,</li>

<li>
assign the file extention "*.jar" to "java.exe -jar " from the jvm, and
you can now just doubleClick on the jar file. (thanx datavanquiser); or,</li>

<li>
assuming that PATH is set to point at java.exe use one of the following
commands from a dos prompt</li>

<ul>
<li>
java -jar MozillaTranslator.jar&nbsp;&nbsp; (or)</li>

<li>
java -cp MozillaTranslator.jar org.mozilla.translator.kernel.Program</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<h4>
Usage</h4>
When the program is started it loads the glossary file if it exists and
if it doesn't it will build one from the chrome. The first time the program
is launhed (or whenever it can't find mozillatranslator.properties)&nbsp;
it will ask for the placement of the chrome. Then there is the following
posibilities for you
<ul>
<li>
"manage filters" manage your filters and a filter is a rule it uses to
test if the Keep original flag should be set when an entry is created</li>

<li>
"Quit" quits the program REMEMBER TO SAVE YOUR GLOSSARY FILE FIRST!!!!!!!!!!!</li>

<li>
"Update glossary" use this if you have downloaded a new version of mozilla.
It will syncronize the entries in the glossary with the new chrome.</li>

<li>
"save glossary" saves the glossary to the disk (file = glossary.zip).</li>

<li>
REMEMBER TO SAVE YOUR GLOSSARY FILE BEFORE QUITEING!!!!</li>

<li>
"import locale from chrome" this will read another locale in from the chrome
(this to import a translation from before V3)</li>

<li>
"export locale to chrome" writes out the files in the destination locale.
it will take all the translated string and build the files that make up
the chrome. if a entry has the keep original flag set it will use the original
string instead. if there are unstranslated strings then their original
text will be used and a warning printed.WARNING: the folder for the files
need to be present otherwise it will fail.</li>

<li>
"import locale from glossary" this will import a previously exported partial
glossary file, it will use the translated text in the file that is imported
and overwrite any you have in you main glossary file. No entries is created
or modified, only their translated text is altered if a new text is in
the file that is imported</li>

<li>
"export locale to glossary" this will export a locale to a partial glossary
file, use these partial glossary files to share the translation with others
using mozillaTranslator.</li>

<li>
"report redundant entries" this will output which entries exists where
the original text is the same.</li>

<li>
"aktivate a locale" this will make mozilla use the locale, you specify.
this is done by creating the appropiate chrome.rdf files</li>

<li>
"view -> The chrome " show the content of the glossary in the same way
as in V2</li>

<li>
"view -> unstranslated" show all entries that doen't have a text in the
sicified locale and that doesn't have the keep original flag set.</li>

<li>
"view -> redundant " show all entries where two or more entries has the
same original text and grouped by the original text. This is nice to see
if all 22 instances of "Cancel" has been translated the same.</li>

<li>
"view -> keep original" list all entries that have the keep original flag
set.</li>
</ul>

<h4>
Issues</h4>

<ul>
<li>
(02/21/2000) The "Edit Entry" function currently only works with a JDK
1.3 JVM, the rest of the program should still run with the 1.2 jvm</li>

<li>
As said the folders for the destination locale must exist.</li>

<li>
The "Pack for submit" action is TEMPORARELY gone.</li>

<li>
ncr style is left "as is" in the strings.</li>

<li>
No resolution on using it on a non native system (I gotta figure out how
to make it pick a better font, and perhaps install one if needed)</li>

<li>
The QA status is only show as number right now, this will change for a
more appropiate dropdown list</li>

<li>
It doesn't pick up the localization notes from the original files.</li>

<li>
There are no progress indicator, so sometimes the system seems to hang
for a while, but it ONLY seams that way, because it isn't redrawing its
UI while performing time consumeing action.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<h2>
<a NAME="mozxlator_v2"></a>Version 2 (Jan. 26, 2000)</h2>

<blockquote><b>Features</b></blockquote>

<ul>
<ul>
<li>
Totally rewritten to root out all hardcoded filtering of things like access
keys</li>

<li>
Real filter support</li>

<li>
Run as downloaded!!!! (you download a jar file)</li>

<li>
Gui setup dialog that is automaticaly displayed on first run</li>

<li>
Auto creates missing folders for destination locale</li>

<li>
Gui support for managing of filters (add,remove and edit)</li>

<li>
Scan files, components or the entire chrome for untranslated strings</li>

<li>
Supports both dtd and properties files (no real xml parser yet though)</li>

<li>
Pack all the translatede files into a zip file for easy distribution</li>

<li>
Turn on/off the translation on a component by component basis.</li>

<li>
Every thing is done in the gui now.</li>
</ul>

<p><br><b>System requirements</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
a Java 2 compatible JVM such as jdk 1.2.2 or 1.3Beta (the linux RC should
work although it is untested)</li>

<li>
a mozilla build installed (nightly,milestone or possible home compiled)</li>
</ul>

<p><br><b>Installation/running</b>
<p>I'm asuming windows here, but other OS should be nearly the same.
<ul>
<li>
download the MozillaTranslator.jar file to where you wanna run the program
from (suggestion: put it in a seperate folder as it creates up to 3 files
more when run)</li>

<li>
go to a DOS promt window and go to the folder where you downloaded MozillaTranslator.jar
to</li>

<li>
type the following&nbsp; command (Case sensitive and without the quotes):
java -cp MozillaTranslator.jar org.mozilla.translator.kernel.Program"</li>

<li>
if that doesn't work try "&lt;full path to java.exe> -cp MozillaTranslator.jar
org.mozilla.translator.kernel.Program"</li>

<li>
alternatively you could download the run.bat file i have included in this
mail and place it in the same folder as MozillaTranslator.jar</li>
</ul>

<p><br>The first time you run the program a setup dialogbox will appear,
fill it with the relevant information, it is prefilled with my information
as an example (please don't change the Source Locale)
<p>If something isn't filled out correctly or has changed delete the generated
MozillaTranslator.properties file and restart the program
<p><b>Usage</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<ul>The basic usage is that the left part shows a tree structure of the
components and files in the chrome, while the right side shows the texts
in the loaded file.The filters in the program is used to tell the program
which strings are not indtended to be localized (like urls and images).
The filters are used when loading and scanning files, but is only used
in the condition that the original and translated text as equal, that is
so that if you need to translatede a text that has otherwise been filtered
you can deselect the keep original check and translate the text. The next
time the file is loaded/scanned it wont be filtered out.</ul>

<p><br><b>The menus</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
LOAD: loads a file, NOTE: it does NOT check to see if the current file
have been saved (yet)</li>

<li>
SAVE: saves the loaded file</li>

<li>
SCAN: scans the file, component or whole chrome depending on the selected
item in the tree, for untranslated strings. Only strings where the original
and translated text are the same AND that hasn't matched a filter is reported,
or if the file hasan't been translated at all.</li>

<li>
PACK: zip up the files from the destination locale (currently saves the
file as checkin.zip in the same directory as mozillaTranslator.jar</li>

<li>
TURN ON/OFF: turns on or off the selected component, when turned on mozilla
will use the translated version. this is done by creating (or deleting)
the appropiate chrome.rdf file</li>

<li>
MANAGE FILTERS: manage (add/edit or remove) filters. the efftect takes
place the next time a file is loaded (or scanned)</li>

<li>
QUIT: quit the program, NOTE: it does NOT check to see if the current file
have been saved (yet)</li>
</ul>

<p><br><b>Bugs and issues</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
The splitter sometimes moves by itself after loading a file or editing
a text</li>

<li>
When turning off a component it deletes the chrome.rdf file instead of
making it use the source locale</li>

<li>
If nothing is selected when a menu is selected then the program will throw
a harmless exception in the console. just ignore it</li>

<br>You can't quit by closing the window, you must use the menu</ul>
</ul>
