<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE="+3">mozilla.org style guide</FONT><BR>
by Jamie Zawinski
 &lt<A HREF="mailto:jwz@mozilla.org">jwz@mozilla.org</A>&gt;
</B></P>

<P> Here are some basic style guidelines for writing content to be
hosted on mozilla.org.  Some are important, some are arbitrary, but
please follow these guidelines in the name of consistency.

<P> Currently, files exist on mozilla.org which don't follow all of these
rules.  That's not a disaster; hopefully we will clean them up someday, but
it's not urgent.  What is most important is that new documents <I>do</I>
follow these guidelines.

<P><OL>

  <P><B><LI>File naming and URLs.</B><P>
  <UL>

    <P><B><LI>Use descriptive file names.</B><BR>

	We are not limited to 8.3 names, so make the file names as long as
	necessary (and no longer.)

    <P><B><LI>The HTML extension is <TT>.html</TT>.</B><BR>
	Not <TT>.htm</TT>.  See 8.3, above.

    <P><B><LI>File names are lower case.</B><BR>

	If you use upper case letters, have a very good reason for it.
	In no event should you have two files in the same directory
	that differ only in case: don't have 
	``<TT>Foo.html</TT>'' and ``<TT>FOO.html</TT>.''

    <P><B><LI>Don't use funny characters in file names.</B><BR>

	Stick to alphanumerics and hyphen.  Our server is a Unix
	machine, and life gets somewhat more difficult if you use
	files with spaces, ampersands, quotes, and so on in their names.
	``<TT>this-and-that.html</TT>'' is good.
	``<TT>This&amp;That.HTM</TT>'' is bad.  You will royally screw
	 anyone using a Macintosh (and Windows, I think) if you use
	 colons, so don't do that.

    <P><B><LI>Hyphenate.</B><BR>

	Don't use StudlyCaps to separate words.  Use hyphens.
	File names aren't Pascal code.
	Don't use underscores to separate words.  Use hyphens.
	File names aren't C code.

    <P><B><LI>File names can be long, if necessary.</B><BR>
	In particular, it might be appropriate for file names to be
	longer than 32 characters.
	But note that if you check such files in, Macintosh users
	will be unable to check them out. If you must deal with files
	with names more than 31 characters in length, you will be
	doing so at the expense of Macintosh users.

    <P><B><LI>Use subdirectories.</B><BR>

	If you have a few files that belong together, or if you expect
	to, make a subdirectory that contains all the related files.

    <P><B><LI>Use <TT>index.html</TT>.</B><BR>

	All subdirectories should have ``<TT>index.html</TT>'' files.

	<P> The <TT>index.html</TT> file should be the main document of
	the directory.  That is, <TT>foobar/foobar.html</TT> is bad.
	<TT>foobar/index.html</TT> is good.

    <P><B><LI>Don't point to <TT>index.html</TT> directly.</B><BR>

	When linking to pages, point to the directory rather than the
	<TT>index.html</TT> file.  When linking to a directory, include the
	trailing slash in the URL.  That is,
	<NOBR><TT>&lt;A HREF="foobar/"&gt;</TT></NOBR> is good,
	<NOBR><TT>&lt;A HREF="foobar/index.html"&gt;</TT></NOBR> is bad,
	<NOBR><TT>&lt;A HREF="foobar"&gt;</TT></NOBR> is bad.

    <P><B><LI>Use relative links whenever possible.</B><BR>

	<NOBR><TT>&lt;A HREF="../../images/bit.gif"&gt;</TT></NOBR> is good.
	<NOBR><TT>&lt;A HREF="/images/bit.gif"&gt;</TT></NOBR> is bad.

  </UL>
  <P><B><LI>HTML coding.</B><BR>
  <UL>

    <P><B><LI>Use LF, not CR or CRLF.</B><BR>

	The standard linebreak character for documents on mozilla.org
	is hereby declared to be LF (decimal <TT>10</TT>, octal
	<TT>012</TT>, hex <TT>0x0A</TT>.)  Keep those CRs out of the
	CVS repository.

    <P><B><LI>Use short lines.</B><BR>

	Some HTML editors like to produce documents that only insert
	line breaks in the HTML source at the ends of paragraphs.
	Don't do that.  Use editors that give the HTML source sensibly
	short lines.  If every paragraph is one long line, then
	``<NOBR><TT>cvs diff</TT></NOBR>'' is mostly useless (since
	<TT>diff</TT> is line-oriented.)  Also there's always the
	chance that some random Unix utility is going to blow a buffer.
	Don't go there.

    <P><B><LI>Don't use <TT>META</TT> tags.</B><BR>

	Composer likes to put in noise like this:

	<P><UL><TABLE CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 BORDER=0 WIDTH="70%">
	 <TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><TT><NOBR>&lt;META </NOBR></TT></TD>
	 <TD VALIGN=TOP><TT>HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type"
		 <NOBR>CONTENT="text/html; charset=iso-8859-1"&gt;</NOBR>
	</TT></TD>
	 </TR></TABLE>
	</UL>

	<P> While a nice touch in theory, back here in the real world,
	that tag makes 3.0-vintage Navigators load the document twice
	and generally lose their minds.  Don't go there.  If you use
	Composer, take this junk out before publishing it.

    <P><B><LI>Use Latin1.</B><BR>

	Don't use Windows-specific characters like open/close double-quotes
	or long-dash.  Don't use Mac-specific characters either.  Make
	sure all characters you use are ISO-8859/1, AKA Latin1.

    <P><B><LI>Don't use <TT>&amp;nbsp;</TT>.</B><BR>

	This is another hateful artifact of Composer: the fact of life
	of HTML is that sentences don't end in two spaces.  Accept it.
	Don't try to work around it by using <TT>&amp;nbsp;</TT>.
	For one thing, most versions of Mozilla have a bug that causes
	<TT>&amp;nbsp;</TT> to display as a random printable character
	when the locale is set to Japanese.  Corollary: use 
	<TT>&lt;PRE&gt;</TT> if you need to; not <TT>&lt;TT&gt;</TT>
	and a bucketful of non-breaking spaces.

    <P><B><LI>Make sure multiple window sizes work.</B><BR>

	Resize the window, both narrow and wide.  Another common
	mistake made by people using HTML editors is the presence 
	of random <TT>&lt;BR&gt;</TT> tags at the ends of lines.

	<P> When resizing the window to be narrow, you may find that
	some words are too long (for example, hyphenated phrases,
	pathnames, or URLs.)  In these cases, use the 
	<TT>&lt;WBR&gt;</TT> tag to indicate the place where it is ok
	to wrap the line within the word.


  </UL>
  <P><B><LI>Look and layout.</B><BR>
  <UL>

    <P><B><LI>Specify document colors.</B><BR>

	All pages must specify their foreground, background, and link
	colors.  These are the colors you should use:

	<P><UL><TABLE CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 BORDER=0 WIDTH="70%">
	 <TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><TT><NOBR>&lt;BODY </NOBR></TT></TD>
	 <TD VALIGN=TOP><TT>BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" TEXT="#000000"
	    LINK="#0000EE" VLINK="#551A8B" ALINK="#FF0000"&gt;</TT></TD>
	 </TR></TABLE>
	</UL>

    <P><B><LI>Don't use 
	<NOBR><TT>&lt;FONT FACE="</TT>...<TT>"&gt;</TT></NOBR>.</B><BR>

	The default fonts chosen by the user are just fine, thanks.

    <P><B><LI>Be careful with table cell colors.</B><BR>

	If you specify the background color of a table cell, you must
	use a light color.  Don't try to produce light text on a dark
	background.  While this might look better in recent browsers,
	in older browsers, people will end up seeing light text on a
	light <NOBR>background --</NOBR> this is because
	<NOBR><TT>&lt;FONT COLOR="</TT>...<TT>"&gt;</TT></NOBR>
	has been supported since version 1.1, but 
	<NOBR><TT>&lt;TD BGCOLOR="</TT>...<TT>"&gt;</TT></NOBR>
	has only been supported since version 3.0.

    <P><B><LI>Use the Mozilla menu.</B><BR>

	Wrap your pages with the Mozilla menu.  This is the default:
	pages can be explicitly <I>not</I> wrapped by listing them
	in the <TT>NOWRAP</TT> file in the same directory; but you
	should avoid doing that unless you've got a really good reason.
	(Note: don't include the HTML for the menu in your files
	directly!  It's added automatically.)

    <P><B><LI>Use indentation.</B><BR>

	If you're writing a document that has sections and subsections,
	indent the subsections using <B><TT>&lt;UL&gt;</TT></B> or
	<B><TT>&lt;DL&gt;</TT></B>.  This is a taste thing, but I find
	documents that only signify headings and subheadings via font
	size (through <B><TT>&lt;H2&gt;</TT></B>,
	<B><TT>&lt;H3&gt;</TT></B>, etc) to be hard to read.  For
	example, I find outdented headings to add a lot of clarity:

	<P>
	<TABLE BORDER CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=16><TR><TD>
	 <FONT SIZE="-1">
	  <FONT SIZE="+1"><B>section a</B></FONT>
	  <P>

	    All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.
	    All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.

	    <P><B>subsection a.1</B>

	    All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.
	    All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.
	  </UL>
	 </FONT>
	</TD></TR></TABLE>

    <P><B><LI>No adjacent headings.</B><BR>

	If you have a heading, and a subheading under it, put some
	intervening text between the two describing the section, and thereby
	introducing the set of subsections.  Not only is this proper style,
	it also improves readability.  The one on the left is better than the
	one on the right:

    <P><B><LI>Avoid all caps.</B><BR>

	I find all-upper-case words in variable-width fonts to be
	unattractive.  If you are talking about SOME_RANDOM_C_TOKEN,
	it's probably better to use <TT>&lt;TT&gt;</TT> for it,
	so that it shows up as <TT>SOME_RANDOM_C_TOKEN</TT> instead.

	<P> Generally, I try to put all C tokens in <TT>&lt;TT&gt;</TT>,
	even lower case ones.  Some people prefer bold or italic, but
	those also look bad with upper-case words.

    <P><B><LI>mozilla.org is spelled in lower case.</B><BR>

	The name of the browser is <B>Mozilla</B>.  It is a proper noun,
	and is therefore capitalized.  The name of the organization is
	<B>mozilla.org</B>.  It is a host name, and therefore, is lower case.
	Even if it is at the beginning of a sentence, it should always be
	lower case.  If it bothers you to begin a sentence with a lower case
	word, rephrase the sentence (it's not hard.)  Never type Mozilla.org
	(or, for that matter, Netscape.com.)

    <P><B><LI>Use a spell checker.</B><BR>

	Say no more.

  </UL>
  <P><B><LI>Content.</B><BR>
  <UL>

    <P><B><LI>Each document's author should be listed at the top.</B><BR>

	If it's a communal document, or an index, it's ok to leave
	the author off.  But if it's a document with real content,
	it should list a way of contacting the author and providing
	feedback.  Anonymity is bad. 

	<P> Look at the top of the document you're reading right now
	for the suggested format.

    <P><B><LI>Eschew marketing obfuscation.</B><BR>

	These are technical documents, folks.  One of the things that
	people seem to like best about the existing content on
	mozilla.org is that it is written by people, for people, without
	bluster or self-promotion.

	<P> When describing something, don't tell people how great it
	is.  Don't tell them how useful it is.  Tell them what it
	does.  Tell them what it's for.

	<P> Don't use buzzwords.  Instead, say what you mean.  
	Never use a long word where a short one would do.
	If it's possible to cut a word out, cut it out.

	<P> Read George Orwell's
	``<A HREF="http://www.k-1.com/Orwell/pol.htm"><B>Politics
	and the English Language</B></A>.''  Read it again.  Have
	it tattooed on the inside of your eyelids.

    <P><B><LI>Separate technical and religious topics.</B><BR>

	It is ok to publish documents which advocate potentially
	controversial ideas or approaches.  However, it is generally better
	if such advocacy not be in the same document as technical
	information.  For example, a document explaining what you have to do
	in order to successfully use C++ is a good thing; and a document
	arguing that you should not use C++ is also a good thing; however,
	they should not be the same document, because the controversial part
	might cause the readers to disregard the factual, non-controversial
	part, and miss out on important information.

    <P><B><LI>Speak for yourself.</B><BR>

	You don't speak for mozilla.org, nor do you speak for Netscape.
	Be careful with the word ``we.''  It would be bad if you made some
	assertion about what mozilla.org (as a whole) believes or desires
	or likes, only to find that there are others in the organization
	who disagree.

	<P> Don't make promises about what mozilla.org or Netscape will or
	will not do in the future.  Hedge your bets with words like ``might''
	or (sometimes) ``probably.''

	<P> Also, if you are a Netscape employee, keep in mind that you
	likely wear two hats: your Netscape hat, where you are concerned with
	shipping Netscape Navigator end-user software; and your mozilla.org
	hat, where you are concerned with shipping source code on which other
	developers can base their own works.  These two jobs are not the
	same, and you should be careful not to conflate the two.

    <P><B><LI>Don't play lawyer.</B><BR>

	Sometimes you may find yourself writing something about what is or is
	not allowed by the terms of the NPL, MPL, or some other license.  Be
	very, very careful.  It's probably best to say nothing at all, but if
	you must, you should defer to the authority of the license itself.
	Unless you actually <I>are</I> a lawyer, you're not qualified to
	interpret what it says, and you don't want to inadvertently say
	something that might get either mozilla.org or Netscape into trouble.
