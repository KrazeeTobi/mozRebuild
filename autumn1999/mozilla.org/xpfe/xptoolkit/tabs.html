<p>
A tab widget provides the user with a facility for switching
between different views using tabs.  The tab is declared using the 
<font color=green>tabcontrol</font> tag.  The tabcontrol is an
extension of the <font color=green>box</font> tag 
(See <a href="boxes.html">The Box System</a> for details.)
<p>
A tab widget can have a <font color=orange>horizontal</font>
or <font color=orange>vertical</font> alignment, which can be
specified using the <font color=red>align</font> attribute on the 
<font color=green>tabcontrol</font> element. 
The tab widget consists of two components: a tab box that contains the
tabs themselves, and a tab panel, which contains the contents that are
switched in and out of view when different tabs are selected.
<p>
The tab box is specified using the <font color=green>tabbox</font> tag.
This tag is also an extension of the <font color=green>box</font>, and
it can also align its children horizontally or vertically using the
<font color=red>align</font> attribute.  Use horizontal alignment to
place the tabs on the left or right of the tab panel and vertical
alignment to place the tabs above or below the tab panel.
<p>
The tab box has individual tabs as its children, and these are declared
using the <font color=green>tab</font> tag.  A tab is also a box, and it
can contain arbitrary content, thus allowing the designer to create
everything from simple tab text labels to complex graphical tabs.
<p>
The tab panel is declared using the <font color=green>tabpanel</font>
tag.  Each child of this element is considered to be a unique view.  
There is a one-to-one correspondence between the tabs in the tab box,
and the views in the tab panel.  For example, clicking on the third
tab (as specified in the tab box) results in the third view 
(as specified in the tab panel) being made visible.

<pre>
&lt;tabcontrol align="vertical"&gt; 
   &lt;tabbox align="horizontal"&gt; 
      &lt;tab&gt;Tab One&lt;/tab&gt; 
      &lt;tab&gt;Tab Two&lt;/tab&gt; 
      &lt;tab&gt;Tab Three&lt;/tab&gt; 
   &lt;/tabbox&gt; 
  
   &lt;tabpanel flex="100%"&gt; 
      &lt;titledbutton value="View One"/&gt; 
      &lt;titledbutton value="View Two"/&gt; 
      &lt;titledbutton value="View Three"/&gt; 
   &lt;/tabpanel&gt; 
&lt;/tabcontrol&gt; 
</table>
<p>
The selected item in the tab panel is reflected in the content model using the
<font color=red>index</font> attribute. <font color=red>[Right now, an attribute called
value is being used instead. This should change any day now.]</font>  This index is
zero-based.
<p>
If the tab widget's width and height are not constrained, the widget will size itself
to fit its largest view (regardless of whether or not that view is initially visible).
All views will be flowed in order to determine the tab's width and height (unless the
widget's width and height are constrained already).
<p>
The tab panel can be used independently of the tab control by using the <font color=green>deck
</font> tag.  It can track selection and size itself to its largest view just as the tab
panel can.
<p>
Border styles can be applied to tabs, and they will be automatically drawn around the view with
a gap between the edge of the tab that is flush with the view.
<p>
<font color=red>Open Issues:
<ul>
<li>There are visibility issues with native widgets that prevent the tab control from working
well with them.
<li>There are issues with tabs wrapping to multiple rows.
</ul>
