<B><FONT SIZE=+2>How to Port NGLayout</FONT></B>
<BR><B>Michael Plitkins</B>
<BR><B>Last updated 8-July-98</B>

<P>So you want to port the new layout engine and it's entrails to another
platform? How do you get from zero to 11 in the shortest time possible?
The following are my recommendations for accomplishing the task. Everyone
has their own way of doing things and if you think you can cut out some
steps or do things a bit more efficiently, go for it. In any case, hopefully
this will help give you some direction if you're lost in the desert (just
make sure you have a computer with a net drop in this mythical desert...).

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>You need to have the code before you can port it</FONT></B><B></B>

<P>Go to <A HREF="http://www.mozilla.org/newlayout">http://www.mozilla.org/newlayout</A>
and grab the New Layout code. It is available both as a tarball with all
of the necessary tools, etc. to build it on several different platforms
and in a CVS source repository. Look at the platforms to which the layout
code has already been ported and find the one that is closest to your target
platform. If you're unsure of which one to go with, grab the Unix/Linux
code. For each platform, there are directions at Mozilla.org on which files
need to be downloaded/pulled. Follow those directions to get the code.
<BR>Note that the new layout code uses a bunch of stuff that is part of
Mozilla. We call this part of the code the 'dist.' Since Mozilla has been
ported to more places than the new layout engine has, it is possible that
the dist code has already been ported to the platform that you are targeting
and this will make your life easier. Check Mozilla.org for information
on ports in progress and their status to see if the code you need has already
been ported. If so, you might also be able to adopt the build system in
place there. Look a the top level makefile/build script for the list of
directories that are considered to be part of the dist. They will be all
of those that aren't labeled as part of nglayout. They might even have
the obvious name of 'dist.'

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Next it needs to compile</FONT></B><B></B>

<P>Depending on how different your target platform is from the ones for
which code exists, you might need to create a new build system. The build
system for each of the current platforms is slightly (or vastly) different
- under Windows, a combination of nmake and gmake (only for parts of the
dist) is used, Unix uses a separate set of makefiles and gmake, and the
Mac uses perl to basically run a build script. If you have GNU tools available,
you might just get away with the Unix build system. The mozilla/config
directory contains a set of files that determine how the build will proceed
based on environment variables that are set before the build begins. See
the pages at <A HREF="http://www.mozilla.org/newlayout/download.html">http://www.mozilla.org/newlayout/download.html</A>
for information on the various environment settings that need to be made
in order to properly build the right bits of code in the dist.

<P>Once a build system seems to work, you need to build things in the right
order and build the right executables. Again, look at the existing makefiles
to see what order the various pieces need to be built it. Once the various
libraries have been created, you will probably get a bunch of compile an
link errors if your build is trying to make the various test apps that
come with the source code. It would probably be a good idea to get some,
or all of the tests to run before attempting to make the actual viewer
test app which exercises all of the code in the dist and new layout engine.
In each source directory for which there are tests available, there is
a tests directory usually containing one or two source files to build a
test app to exercise some of the code in the relevant module. It would
probably be a good idea to build the tests in the mozilla/xpcom directory
as a starter.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Now it links, where to go from here?</FONT></B><B></B>

<P>If you've got the xpcom test app linking (and maybe it even runs), what
do you do next to start making things real? First off, if you don't have
a working dist, you need to get that to go before you have a prayer of
getting the new layout enging up and running. That's priority one and outside
the scope of this document. See Mozilla.org pages for more info. Once the
dist code seems healthy, come back here.

<P>There are three parts of the new layout engine that are not cross platform
and therefore need to be implemented for each environment to which it is
ported. These are parts of mozilla/base, parts of mozilla/gfx and mozilla/widget:

<P>mozilla/base contains a public interface called nsITimer that is used
for triggering timeouts. There is also a test directory in base containing
a test app to exercise the timer.

<P>mozilla/gfx contains a set of interfaces to enable cross platform rendering
of lines, rects, text, images, etc. All of the graphics interfaces are
spec'ed in mozilla/gfx/src. The set of interfaces that have XP implementations
have corresponding .cpp files in gfx/src. The remaining interfaces are
implemented per-platform in subdirectories of gfx/src. For a list of exactly
which interfaces need to be implemented, use gfx/src/windows as a guide.

<P>mozilla/widget contains a set of interfaces for cross platform support
of user interface widgets (i.e. button, scrollbar, editfield, etc). To
date, the implementation of the widgets is completely platform dependent
so there is no code shared among the various implementations. The scope
of widgets and there functionality is essentially that required to support
HTML form elements. The interfaces are defined in widget/public and there
are per-platform subdirectories in widget/src.

<P>In addition, there are some non XP parts of the viewer test app that
will need to be ported, and they live in mozilla/webshell/tests/viewer.
This is mostly code to attach menus to an nsIWidget and run the main message
dispatch loop. Basically, the equivalent of main() needs to be written
that brings up a window (there is XP code for doing this using the widget
library), attach some menus for debugging, handle the main app message
loop and respond to menu events. See webshell/tests/viewer/winmain.cpp
for an example of what needs to be done.

<P>In order to have a fully working layout engine, each of these non XP
pieces of code needs to be fully implemented, but to get things limping
along, a minimal subset can be implemented (along with additional simple
test apps) to bring up simple HTML pages.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Crawl, Walk, Run</FONT></B><B></B>

<P>Get the timer test app to work since in order for the viewer to ever
link there needs to be some implementation of nsITimer. It's also another
good test of the xpcom code.

<P>At this point, were you to write a version of the non XP code in mozilla/webshell/tests/viewer
you would be able to link the viewer but it would fail to run until there
are factories for the graphics and widget objects.

<P>It is the order in which these factories and the objects that they build
for you that is the key to getting something up and running quickly. I
would first recommend writing the factories themselves (clone the Windows
version) and then write stub implementations of each of the interfaces
that need to be implemented in gfx and widget. Many of the interface methods
will require that return codes be provided and/or that output parameters
be supplied in "positive" ways. This means that you should attempt to have
methods that return something to the caller return values that "make sense"
and allow the caller to continue working rather than just failing. If you
do this, then the methods can be implemented for real one-by-one in the
right order and slowly parts of the viewer and other test apps will begin
to work. We really need to have boiler plate implementations of the various
interfaces, but we don't at this time.

<P>To begin implementing things for real, start with the widgets. Four
(really two) basic widgets need to work in order for the viewer to function.
These are, according to CID: NS_WINDOW_CID, NS_CHILD_CID, NS_HORZSCROLLBAR_CID
and NS_VERTSCROLLBAR_CID.

<P>NS_WINDOW_CID is a top level window with chrome and represents the base
window class.

<P>NS_CHILD_CID is a window like NS_WINDOW_CID, but without chrome.

<P>NS_HORZSCROLLBAR_CID and NS_VERTSCROLLBAR_CID represent the two basic
varieties of scrollbars.

<P>Care must be taken in implementing the widget classes in that the new
layout engine uses xpcom aggregation with the widgets to bind them to layout
engine "views." What this means is that the layout engine, given a pointer
to a widget, will call the widget's QueryInterface() method asking for
an object of type nsIView which has been associated with the widget when
it was instantiated. It is important that the widget hold a reference to
the object aggregated in and if the IID passed in to QueryInterface() is
not understood, then it is passed into the aggregated object's QueryInterface()
and the result of that is returned. If this mechanism doesn't work then
event handling in the viewer will be broken (hint, hint). This code should
really be factored out so that it doesn't need to be implemented per-platform.

<P>As far as event handling goes, see nsGUIEvent.h for a list of the events
that need to be supported. The most critical are those that are related
to window geometry, painting, scrolling and mouse handling. Once you have
some basic widgets working, you can check to see that you are passing the
proper events at the proper time to the application by putting a break
point in the global event handler in mozilla/views/src/nsView.cpp. It's
the C callback at the top of the file. It cares about resize and paint
events which are the most fundamental to driving the viewer.

<P>Once you start getting paint events, it would be a good time to have
the mozilla/gfx code working so that you can render what the layout code
has processed. An intermediate step to getting the viewer to render (which
really exercises all of the rendering classes to the maximum extent) is
to get the Scribble test app in widget/tests/scribble to work to some degree.
It will try to create and use more widgets than the viewer will, but at
the very least, a working Scribble app will come up and allow you to click
in the right hand side of the window, move the mouse and draw lines. If
you want to implement more of the widgets that it tries to instantiate,
additional functionality will be revealed... There is also a windows-only
test app in mozilla/gfx/tests/btest that you might want to port if you're
having difficulty with the rendering context, blender, or image classes.

<P>The non XP implementations of the mozilla/gfx classes that must work
and what in them must work follow in prioritized order:

<P>nsIDeviceContext: everything here is fairly critical. You can lie about
the DPI queries and return identity values.

<P>nsIFontMetrics: you can initially support a single font for all font
requests, but all metric queries must return sensible values or text layout
won't work right. If you lie about the queries, then the results of rendering
text may result in large gaps or overlaps between groups of words when
rendered.

<P>nsIRenderingContext: all methods that return something from the rendering
context must work including those for handling drawing surfaces. They are
used for double buffering. Clipping APIs must work, along with PushState()
and PopState(). The critical objects that need to be pushed/popped are:
clip regions, color, font. If any of these don't get pushed/popped properly,
some garbage wil appear in the output, most obvious is incorrect clip region
state management. The more output methods that work, the more you will
see in your HTML documents.

<P>nsIRegion: all methods except for the rect enumerator need to work.

<P>nsIImage: at the very least, this needs to properly instantiate itself
so that HTML pages with images don't fail. Beyond that, it needs to be
able to draw itself. Eventually, the Optimize() method should work to improve
performace of image rendering if possible.

<P>nsIBlender: currently, not critical to functionality of viewer.

<P>When you get the viewer to begin loading and rendering pages, finish
fleshing out the rendering classes and then continue with the widgets.
Once the widgets work, you will be able to display pages with HTML form
elements.

<P>At good points in the crawl, walk, run growth process submit your code
to the appropriate Mozilla.org module owners so that it gets incorporated
back into the source distribution and other like minded people can aid
the whole development effort.
