&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by Wislawa Szymborska - 1972
<blockquote>I am a tranquilizer.
<br>I am effective at home,
<br>I work well at the office,
<br>I take exams,
<br>I appear in court,
<br>I carefully mend broken crockery -
<br>all you need do is take me,
<br>dissolve me under the tongue,
<br>all you need do is swallow me,
<br>just wash me down with water.
<p>I know how to cope with misfortune,
<br>how to endure bad news,
<br>take the edge of injustice,
<br>make up for the absence of God,
<br>help pick out your widow's weeds.
<br>What are you waiting for -
<br>have faith in chemistry's compassion.
<p>You're still a young man/woman,
<br>you really should settle down somehow.
<br>Who said
<br>life must be lived courageously?
<p>Hand your abyss over to me -
<br>I will line it up with soft sleep,
<br>you'll be grateful for
<br>the four-footed landing.
<p>Sell me your soul.
<br>There's no other buyer likely to turn up.
<p>There's no other devil left.</blockquote>
