Letter of Invitation: Bringing Mozilla Localization Project toward M14</h1></center>

<p>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>
<p>Hello, All:
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>In the summer of 1999, the Mozilla Localization Project (MLP) quietly
formed among a group of enthusiasts who volunteer to localize Mozilla client
into their languages. In less than 6 months, we have nineteen languages
registered and two localization tools, "MozExpTool" and "MozillaTranslator",
contributed and utilized by localization participants. This is a great
encouragement of the open source movement. It makes us so proud of being
a part of this project.
<p>At the same time, after months of continuous efforts, the core technology
of the Mozilla is getting mature. The stability and the performance of
milestone builds improves release after release. It appears to be the time
to bring the Mozilla Localization Project a step further.
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>
<h4>
Primary Goal</h4>
Utilize the contributed localization tools to localize the Mozilla client
M14 build into all the sixteen registered languages.
<p>A few days ago, Mozilla released M13 build. Since this is the first
public release after Mozilla Alpha Release, lots features and improvement
have been checked in. It is expected that the milestone release after M13
be more stable and robust. Therefore, I'd like to invite you to localize
the <b>M14</b> and ship all languages <b>in the same time frame</b> as
the English build. In other words, let's ship all our language packs within
15 days, after the US build ships. Although, nothing could prevent us from
even shipping language packs simultaneously with the US build!
<p>Note that the planned schedule for M14 is
<blockquote>tree close: Feb 15, 2000
<br>on the wire: Feb. 18, 2000</blockquote>

<h4>
Status of the Language Packs</h4>
There are nineteen languages registered on the "Localizing Mozilla" page,
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/intl/xul-how2l10n.html#mlp">http://www.mozilla.org/projects/intl/xul-how2l10n.html#mlp</a>.
They include Bosnian (bosnian-BA), Catalan, Czech, Danish (da-DK), French,
Georgian, German, Greek, Hawaiian, Indonesian, Japanese, Norwegian, Polish,
Portuguese (pt-BR, pt-PT), Russian, Spanish (es-CO and es-ES), and Thai.
While Czech, German, Indonesian, Japanese, and Polish are at M12,&nbsp;
Thai is at M10, Danish in M9, and Bosnian at M8.
<p>More amazingly, Japanese M13 candidate build and German M13 build had
been delivered soon after the US bit gets on the wire.
<h4>
Status of the Localization and Leveraging Tools</h4>
There are two contributed tools so far: the MozExpTool (by Jordi Mas) and
the MozillaTranslator (by Henrik Lynggaard).
<blockquote>
<li>
<i>MozExpTool</i>. A VisualC++ based project. It is designed to address
the localization and leveraging need of languages in single-byte charsets.
Both source code and WIN32 binary are available. More detailed technical
spec can be found here,&nbsp; <a href="http://www.rebost.net/mozexptool/">http://www.rebost.net/mozexptool/</a>
.</li>

<li>
<i>MozillaTranslator</i>. A GUI-based Localization and Leveraging tool
written in Java. Although still in development stage, it is suitable for
both single-byte and double-byte charsets including all Latin-1, 2, and
CJK (Chinese, Japanese, and Korean): nearly all languages covered by Unicode.
The package is available as a single jar file together with a DOS batch
driver. JDK.1.2.2 is needed to run the program.</li>
</blockquote>

<h4>
How to proceed</h4>
In the past, most of us work independently and randomly pick a milestone
build to work on. The drawback of this is that there is little coordination
among the team and result in less productivity. To avoid such problem in
the future, I'd like to suggest that we participate in a more organized
fashion:
<ul>
<li>
Let's identify what is needed in the process of localization and leveraging
and distribute them among the team. Here are a list of things I can think
of now:</li>

<ul>
<li>
<i>Use localization/leveraging tools</i> to improve our productivity. It'd
be a waste of time and error prone if we need to localize each build from
scratch. With the MozillaTranslator or MozExpTool, you can identify which
strings are new and need to be localized.</li>

<li>
<i>Compile a glossary file from previous releases</i> (including Communicator
4.x) for reference. Translation consistency and quality can be greatly
improved if there are glossary files for reference.</li>

<li>
<i>QA the localization results</i>. This is to have the language pack reviewed
and tested so that bugs or flows can be identified beforehand and thus
avoid respinning of the localized builds.</li>

<li>
<i>Push the localized build up to Mozilla.org's FTP site.</i> Once we push
the localized builds up to the FTP sites, I expect more people to download
and use them since the FTP download sites get more visibility than the
MLP's home page.</li>

<li>
<i>Make formal announcement.</i> In addition to the FTP download sites,
we can use the open source community channels such as formal Mozilla Release
announcement, visible links in the Mozilla download page, articles in the
Mozillazine, and Mozilla newsgroups. Other channels such as locale-specific
newsgroups are also good places to make our contribution visible.</li>
</ul>

<li>
In theory, we'd like to have them all and utilize them in localizing M14.
In reality, let's take advantage of the best we can do and give it a shot.</li>

<li>
Please pass this invitation to the people you know might be interested
in participating MLP.</li>

<li>
Down load latest Mozilla <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/seamonkey/release-notes/index.html">Releases</a>
. I'd encourage you to start with M13 and then use the tools to leverage
the results to M14 which is expected to be a more mature and stable build.</li>

<li>
Follow the instructions in "Localizing Mozilla", <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/intl/xul-how2l10n.html">http://www.mozilla.org/projects/intl/xul-how2l10n.html</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h4>
Coordination</h4>

<blockquote>
<li>
Direct comments, feed backs, and questions to <a href="news://news.mozilla.org/netscape.public.mozilla.l10n">news://news.mozilla.org/netscape.public.mozilla.l10n</a>.</li>

<li>
Real time chats, IRC session, will be held weekly (or from time to time
when needed) to facilitate project coordination, discussion and experience
sharing.</li>
</blockquote>

<h4>
Mozilla Open Source client v.s. Netscape branded client</h4>
There will be planned beta releases (and the final RTM) of Netscape branded
builds. Netscape might choose to localize some or all of them into languages
such as German, French, Japanese, etc... See&nbsp; <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/intl/xul-how2l10n.html#FAQ">FAQ</a>
for more information.</blockquote>

<p><br>Please direct questions and feedbacks to <a href="news://news.mozilla.org/netscape.public.mozilla.l10n">news://news.mozilla.org/netscape.public.mozilla.l10n</a>.
Again, feel free to pass this invitation to people you know might be interested.
