NSPR 2.0: Addresses of automatic variables</H2>
This is a cautionary note that may be old information for some of you.
However, since it affects the portability of code, it was deemed prudent
to include a short memo describing the issue.
<H3>
Problem statement</H3>
WIN-16 (aka, Windows 3.1, et al), is unique in that the architecture depends
on the Operating Environment (i.e., Windows) knows the address of the stack,
and that there is only one such address. Consequently, implementing threads,
with their implication of a unique stack for each thread, requires that
the NSPR runtime <I>copy</I> the stacks during thread context switches.

<P>The actual copying of the stack is not such a hardship as one would
imagine. With the speed of today's processors (even those running WIN-16),
the copying of 10 - 50 kilobytes of data between two locations in memory
is barely measurable.<SUP>1</SUP> What is a hardship is that addresses
of dynamic variables, those allocated on the call stack, in a function's
local frame, are not valid across thread boundaries.

<P>The simplest demonstration of the problem is as follows:

<P><UL><PRE>
typedef struct SharedData
{
    PRLock *ml;
    PRCondVar *cv;
    PRInt32 counter;
} SharedData;

static void ForkedThread(void *arg)
{
    SharedData *shared = (SharedData*)arg;
    while (--shared->counter > 0)
        PR_WaitCondVar(shared->cv,
                       PR_INTERVAL_NO_TIMEOUT);
    return;
}  /* <I>ForkedThread</I> */

PRIntn main(PRIntn argc, char **argv)
{
    PRThread *thread;
    SharedData shared;
    shared.ml = PR_NewLock();
    shared.cv = PR_NewCondVar(shared.ml);
    shared.exitNow = 10;
    thread = PR_CreateThread(PR_USER_THREAD,
        ForkedThread, &amp;shared, 
        PR_PRIORITY_NORMAL, PR_LOCAL_THREAD,
        PR_JOINABLE_THREAD, 0);
    do
    {
        PR_Sleep(PR_SecondsToInterval(1));
        PR_Lock(shared.ml);
        if (0 == shared.counter) break;
        PR_NotifyCondVar(shared.cv);
        PR_Unlock(shared.ml);
    } while (PR_TRUE);

    rv = PR_JoinThread(thread);
    return (PR_SUCCESS == rv) ? 0 : 1;
}
</PRE></UL><P>

<P>This is a completely correct (albeit trivial) program that will run
predictably on all NSPR 2.0 platforms other than WIN-16. On WIN-16, the
thread's attempt to address the <B><TT>SharedData </TT></B>through the
pointer <TT><B>shared</B> </TT>will provide interesting (though always
incorrect) results. It's difficult to tell exaclty where the updated <B><TT>counter
</TT></B>is being stored. The only portable manner to write this program
requires that the shared structure be allocated from the heap. Well, that
isn't so hard to remember, is it?

<P>What is probably more likely to cause problems is passing addresses
of automatically allocated variables to a function that wends its way though
arbitrary amounts of convoluted logic, and finds its way into an object
that is shared. One should be particularly cautious of arrays since they
are passed by reference by default.

<P>_______________
<BR><SUP>1</SUP> It is possible that our ability to measure the costs is
not up to the task.
