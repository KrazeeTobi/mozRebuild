<P>We make the following assumptions and requirements on the implementation
of the Java virtual machine:</P>

<H3>General</H3>


<UL>
  <LI>All values will use their native endian conventions and alignments.
  <LI>All floating-point arithmetic will be done using IEEE arithmetic using
  the precision and rounding as specified by the Java specification <A HREF=
  "bibliography.html#GJS96">[GJS96]</A>. On processors such as the x86 this
  means that we'll have to generate extra code to reduce the 80-bit precision
  of intermediate results down to Java's IEEE 64 or 32-bit formats.
  <LI>We will <I>initialize</I> a Java class only lazily, at its first active
  use (<A HREF="bibliography.html#GJS96">[GJS96]</A> page 223), but we reserve
  the right to do eager or partially eager class <I>resolution</I> (<A HREF=
  "bibliography.html#GJS96">[GJS96]</A> page 217). This means that when a
  Java class C1 is run, other classes referenced, directly or indirectly,
  from C1 may be verified and resolved (but not initialized) even if C1 has
  not yet actively used them. This is consistent with the spirit and the
  letter of the Java specification. We realize that there may be user-visible
  advantages in doing class resolution lazily, and we'll try to reach a compromise
  between the users' ability to run programs that are incomplete (specifically,
  not strictly resolvable) in various ways and the implementation complexity
  that supporting this would require.
</UL>

<H3>Java Objects</H3>


<UL>
  <LI>The compiled code refers to Java objects via pointers. No double indirection
  is needed.
  <LI>Each Java object consists of a small, fixed-size header and instance
  fields; we can access these via fixed offsets from the object's pointer.
  All data in an object is contiguous.
  <LI>Fields of Java type <CODE>boolean</CODE>, <CODE>byte</CODE>, <CODE>char</CODE>,
  <CODE>short</CODE>, <CODE>int</CODE>, <CODE>long</CODE>, <CODE>float</CODE>,
  <CODE>double</CODE> and <CODE>Object</CODE> (or any subclass thereof) are
  laid out exactly like the target system's C compiler would lay out <CODE>struct</CODE>
  fields of type <CODE>char</CODE>, <CODE>int8</CODE>, <CODE>uint16</CODE>,
  <CODE>int16</CODE>, <CODE>int32</CODE>, <CODE>int64</CODE>, <CODE>float32</CODE>,
  <CODE>float64</CODE>, and <CODE>void*</CODE> respectively.
  <LI>Java <CODE>null</CODE> is represented by a zero pointer.
  <LI>A Java array consists of a small, fixed-size header (in the same format
  and offset as a non-array object's header), an element count word, and
  the contents of the array. The number of elements in an array is set when
  the array is created and cannot be changed afterwards. No double indirection
  is needed to access an array element.
  <LI><CODE>boolean</CODE> arrays use one byte per element, just like <CODE>byte</CODE>
  arrays. (We can implement packed <CODE>boolean</CODE> arrays in the future.)
  <LI>An object's header contains information that can be used to quickly
  find the object's class and that class's method lookup tables.
</UL>

<H3>Calling Conventions</H3>


<UL>
  <LI>Compiled methods use the native C++ parameter and result-passing conventions.
  When the native C and C++ parameter and result-passing conventions differ,
  we will use the C++ conventions because they are generally more efficient.
  <LI>Compiled methods use the native C/C++ register saving and restoring
  conventions.
  <LI>Compiled methods use the native C++ register frame layout conventions.
  <LI>Unless doing so would be a burden or inefficient, the virtual machine
  will use the preferred native means for examining frames on the stack (for
  purposes such as security checks).
  <LI>Unless doing so would be a burden or inefficient, the virtual machine
  will use the same exception-throwing and stack-unwinding conventions as
  the native C++ compiler. This reduces the complexity of unwinding thrown
  exceptions past native stack frames.
  <LI>It is our intent that no stubs will be required to call between native
  and Java methods.
</UL>

<H3>Method Dispatching</H3>


<UL>
  <LI>We will use vtables for dispatching method calls on methods defined
  in classes. We have not yet specified an approach for dispatching method
  calls on methods defined in interfaces.
</UL>

<H3>Synchronization</H3>


<UL>
  <LI>We assume that context switches between threads or processes can happen
  at any time, even in the middle of executing a native instruction (this
  might happen if we're running on a multiprocessor). We assume that the
  only atomic operations are the native instructions that specifically guarantee
  synchronization.
  <LI>We will assume some reasonable standard model about consistency between
  memory operations of native threads running concurrently. For instance,
  we could assume that all memory accesses can be put into a total chronological
  order that is consistent with the partial order that each native thread
  perceives. However, if desirable, we could choose to assume a less demanding
  shared memory model.
  <LI>We do not assume that the operating system lets us run any special
  code when context switching.
  <LI>On some or all platforms we may want to have a fast way to reach thread-local
  storage from an executing thread.
</UL>

<H3>Garbage Collection</H3>


<UL>
  <LI>We will provide enough information so that the run-time system can
  determine the exact type of every instance field of every Java object and
  array; thus Java objects and arrays can be scanned nonconservatively.
  <LI>We may or may not be able to provide exact typing information for data
  in registers and on the stack.
  <LI>We intend to never have a situation where an object is live but the
  only pointers to it are interior pointers (i.e. point to its middle instead
  of its beginning). Hence, a conservative garbage collector can safely ignore
  pointers that don't point to the beginning of an object (assuming that
  native methods follow the same convention).
  <LI>To reduce the possibility of an integer masquerading as a pointer to
  the beginning of an object, we are able to offset all object field accesses
  by a small constant (thus making all true object pointers end in a bit
  pattern other than 00). We'd only do this if the garbage collector so desires.
  <LI>To eliminate stale object pointers on the stack, we could provide information
  about which stack slots are live and/or clear dead slots. Note, however,
  that the latter would lead to a loss of performance.
</UL>
