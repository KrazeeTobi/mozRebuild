<BR>No.  mozilla.org cannot legally release the cryptographic source
code included in Netscape Communicator for general distribution as part
of the Mozilla source release, for the following reasons:<BR>
<BR>
<UL>
<P><LI>
Export from the US of cryptographic source code, including making such
code available for general download over the Internet, is controlled and
restricted by the US government (except in the special case of export to
Canada).  Under existing regulations the US government would not grant
mozilla.org the export license needed to release the cryptographic source
code included in Netscape Communicator.</LI>

<P><LI>
The cryptographic source code in Netscape Communicator includes code licensed
from third parties, most notably RSA Data Security.  mozilla.org does
not have rights to redistribute that code in source form, even in a situation
where export from the US is not an issue (for example, allowing downloads
only from within the US).</LI>
</UL>
<BR>
For more information see the US <A HREF="http://jya.com/eartoc.htm">Export
Administration Regulations</A>, particularly <A HREF="http://jya.com/734.htm">15
CFR Part 734</A>, <A HREF="http://jya.com/742.htm">742</A>, and <A HREF="http://jya.com/774-ccl05.htm">774,

<A NAME="1-2"></A><B>Why couldn't mozilla.org release just the cryptographic
source code for the "40-bit" version of Netscape Communicator currently
being exported from the US?</B></LI>

<BR>Under existing US government regulations US-based companies, organizations,
and individuals must obtain an export license for <I>any</I> software implementing
cryptographic functionality, regardless of the strength of the encryption
used.  Netscape currently distributes the exportable ("40-bit") version
of Netscape Communicator under a special export license granted to mass-market
software products that a) implement only RC4 and/or RC2 encryption using
a 40-bit key and b) are available in executable form only.

<P>However distribution of such a "40-bit" product in source form (including
cryptographic source code) would require a separate export license, and
under existing regulations the US government would not grant such a license,
at least for the unmodified source code.  (The presumed justification
for this is that it would be almost trivially easy to change such source
code to enable encryption with key lengths longer than 40 bits.)

<P>For more information see the US <A HREF="http://jya.com/eartoc.htm">Export
Administration Regulations</A>, particularly <A HREF="http://jya.com/742.htm#742.15">15
CFR Part 742.15 paragraph (b)(1)</A>, <A HREF="http://jya.com/742.htm#742s6">742,

<P><LI>
<A NAME="1-3"></A><B>Even if mozilla.org can't release the cryptographic
source code itself, will it release source code for SSL and S/MIME along
with appropriate APIs, so that people outside the US could add the necessary
cryptographic code?</B></LI>

<BR>Netscape Communicator does in fact use a standard API to invoke cryptographic
functions, namely the PKCS#11 (or "Cryptoki") API defined by RSA Data Security,
and also allows those cryptographic functions to be supplied by a separate
PKCS#11-compliant module developed by a third party.  However the
US government has traditionally considered software that calls cryptographic
functions to be subject to cryptographic export controls, even if the software
itself contains no cryptographic code but rather just calls external cryptographic
libraries through a defined API.  (This is sometimes referred to as
"crypto with a hole".)

<P>In particular, distribution of Communicator source code implementing
SSL or S/MIME and calling separate cryptographic functions through an API
would require an export license even in the absence of code implementing
any such cryptographic functions, and under existing regulations the US
government would not grant such a license, at least for the source code
as it currently exists.  (The presumed justification for this is that
it would be almost trivially easy to link such source code with an external
cryptographic library developed outside the US.)

<P>For more information on export control of mass market software invoking
cryptographic functions see the US <A HREF="http://jya.com/eartoc.htm">Export
Administration Regulations</A>, particularly <A HREF="http://jya.com/742.htm#742s6">15
CFR Part 742, Supplement 6</A> concerning export licenses for mass market
software such as Netscape Communicator; note in particular paragraph (b)(3)(v)(E),
which addresses how source code for mass market software calling cryptographic
functions must be modified for export from the US (e.g., by removing all
cryptographic code and calls to such code).  For more information
on the PKCS#11 API and Netscape's PKCS#11 support in Communicator, see
the <A HREF="http://www.rsa.com/rsalabs/pubs/PKCS/html/pkcs-11.html">PKCS#11

documentation</A>, and Netscape's <A HREF="http://developer.netscape.com/support/faqs/pkcs_11.html">PKCS#11
FAQ</A>. <BR>
<BR>
<P><LI>
<A NAME="1-4"></A><B>Isn't Microsoft's CryptoAPI implementation an example
of exportable code that invokes cryptographic functions through an API? 
Why couldn't mozilla.org do the same with the Communicator SSL and S/MIME
code?</B></LI>

<BR>It is in fact possible under certain circumstances to obtain an export
license for software invoking cryptographic functions through an API. 
For example, Microsoft's implementation of the Microsoft Cryptographic
API (CryptoAPI) specification was approved for export from the US, even
though it implements an API by which third parties, including third parties
outside the US, can add separate modules ("Cryptographic Service Providers"
or CSPs) implementing cryptographic functionality.  This export approval
was presumably made possible because a) the CryptoAPI implementation requires
third party CSPs to be digitally signed by Microsoft and rejects attempts
to call CSPs not so signed; b) through this signing process Microsoft can
ensure compliance with the relevant US export control regulations (e.g.,
they presumably would not sign a CSP developed outside the US that implements
strong cryptography); and c) Microsoft's CryptoAPI implementation is available
only in executable form, and thus is presumed to be reasonably resistant
to user tampering to disable the CSP digital signature check.

<P>This last reason is the most important with respect to distribution
of the Mozilla code; since the Mozilla distribution will be in the form
of source code mozilla.org cannot follow the CryptoAPI example in this
case.  US export regulations do in fact provide a procedure by which
such source code can be exported; however it essentially requires the removal
of any and all source code references involving the invocation of cryptographic
functions.  (This happens to be what Netscape is doing to prepare
the Mozilla source release for general distribution.)

<P>For more information on export control of mass market software invoking
cryptographic functions see the <A HREF="#1-3">question</A> above. 
For more information on Microsoft's CryptoAPI and export control see the
<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/msdn/join/">Microsoft Developer Network
Online</A>. <BR>
<BR>
<P><LI>
<A NAME="1-5"></A><B>Aren't TCP/IP socket calls and other comparable APIs
examples of "hooks" by which cryptographic functionality can be added? 
If TCP/IP source code can be exported from the US, why couldn't mozilla.org
do the same with the SSL and S/MIME source code?</B></LI>

<BR>There are multiple mechanisms by which software can transform data
or communicate data over networks, and often these mechanisms are invoked
using defined APIs resulting in calls to code in separate modules. 
For purposes of US export control how are mechanisms like SSL and S/MIME
(and their associated APIs) to be distinguished from mechanisms like socket
calls and MIME-type handlers (and <I>their</I> associated APIs)?  
The US export regulations are not explicit on this point, but one possible
guide may be the definitions in the regulations of the terms "cryptography"
and "encryption software".

<P>The regulations define "cryptography" as "the discipline that embodies
principles, means and methods for the transformation of data in order to
hide its information content, prevent its undetected modification or prevent
its unauthorized use", and go on to say that "'cryptography' is limited
to the transformation of information using one or more 'secret parameters'
(e.g., crypto variables) and/or associated key management", where a "secret
parameter" is in turn defined as "a constant or key kept from the knowledge
of others or shared only within a group".  Similarly, the regulations
define "encryption software" as "computer programs that provide capability
of encryption functions or confidentiality of information or information
systems".

<P>So the distinction between sockets and SSL and between MIME-type handlers
and S/MIME can presumably be made as follows:  Both SSL and S/MIME
were explicitly designed and have as one of their main functions to "hide
... information content" and "provide ... confidentiality of data"; therefore
software implementing SSL and S/MIME is considered to be "encryption software"
using "cryptography" and thus subject to the relevant export control regulations. 
However mechanisms such as sockets and MIME-type handlers communicate and/or
transform data only in a general sense, and in particular do not (necessarily)
require using "secret parameters" or "key management"; thus software implementing
APIs to such mechanisms is not considered "encryption software" in the
context of US export control regulations.  Such software may still
require an US export license, but under less restrictive terms; if it is
mass market commercial software it would typically be exportable under
the "TSU" license exemption (for "Technology and Software -- Unrestricted"),
and if it is "published" software (as most free software would be) it may
not be subject to US export control regulations at all.

<P>For more information see the US <A HREF="http://jya.com/eartoc.htm">Export
Administration Regulations</A>, particularly <A HREF="http://jya.com/772.htm">15
CFR Part 772</A> (definitions of "cryptography" and "encryption software"),
<A HREF="http://jya.com/740.htm#740.13">740.13</A> (the "TSU" license exemption),
and <A HREF="http://jya.com/734.htm#734.3">734.3 paragraph (b)</A> and
<A HREF="http://jya.com/734.htm#734.7">734.7</A> ("published" software). <BR>
<BR>
<P><LI>
<A NAME="1-6"></A><B>Why couldn't mozilla.org export the cryptographic
source code in Communicator as a printed book, as was done with PGP?</B></LI>

<BR>US export control regulations dealing with cryptographic software exempt
material published in printed form, presumably to minimize the possibility
of legal challenges to those regulations under the First Amendment to the
US constitution.  In 1995 MIT Press published the source code for
PGP in book form; presumably it was and is legal to export this from the
US, taking advantage of the relevant exemption.  In any case, copies
were indeed obtained by people outside the US, who proceeded to convert
the printed source code to electronic form by scanning it using optical
character recognition (OCR) software.  Recently Network Associates
(the current developer of the commercial US version of PGP) announced that
a full-strength commercial version of PGP was being made available outside
the US based on work done at a non-US company; that work was presumably
based on the PGP source code previously legally exported.  (In essence
Network Associates' business model for selling commercial versions of PGP
worldwide does not depend on their obtaining a US export license; in this
they differ from Netscape and other US software companies.)

<P>At this time mozilla.org has no plans to distribute Mozilla cryptographic
code in this manner, for a variety of reasons; one major reason is that
the cryptographic source code in Netscape Communicator includes code licensed
from third parties, most notably RSA Data Security, and mozilla.org does
not have rights to redistribute that code in source form, whether printed
or not.

<A NAME="1-7"></A><B>Wasn't John Gilmore able to export cryptographic source
code in electronic form?  Why couldn't mozilla.org follow his example?</B></LI>

<BR>John Gilmore recently announced that he was releasing for general distribution
cryptographic source code intended to be used in providing enhanced security
for the Internet Domain Name System (DNS).  In doing this Gilmore
took advantage of a provision in the US government export control regulations
that specifically exempted from export control cryptographic code designed
to be used only to provide authentication (e.g., using digital signature
techniques) and <I>not</I> to provide privacy (i.e., using encryption). 
The provision in question did not distinguish between the cases where such
code was released in object form vs. source form; hence Gilmore chose to
release the DNS security software in source form.

<P>mozilla.org cannot make use of this particular exemption because the
Communicator source code as it exists today, particularly the implementation
of SSL and S/MIME, is explicitly designed to provide privacy through encryption.

<P>For more information see John Gilmore's <A HREF="http://www.toad.com/dnssec/pressrel1.txt">press
release</A> and <A HREF="http://www.toad.com/dnssec/pressrel1.background.txt">press
backgrounder</A>; although this is not explicitly stated in Gilmore's materials,
the provisions in the US <A HREF="http://jya.com/eartoc.htm">Export Administration
Regulations</A> which Gilmore used as justification were presumably <A HREF="http://jya.com/774-ccl05.htm">15

<A NAME="1-8"></A><B>I've read that people can legally take the US version
of Netscape Communicator out of the US on their laptops.  If they
are able to do this without US government interference, why can't mozilla.org
export Mozilla cryptographic source code without interference?</B></LI>

<BR>It is in fact true that US-based individuals can take cryptographic
software (including the US version of Netscape Communicator) out of the
US pre-loaded on laptops or other computer systems without getting an export
license.  This is possible under a special export license exemption
in which cryptographic software is considered to be a "tool of trade" used
by the US-based individual in the course of their business; such software
may be taken out of the US temporarily, but must remain under the control
of the person exporting it and must be returned to the US when the person
returns (more or less -- it might be shipped back separately).  The
regulations allow a maximum time out of the US of one year.

<P>This particular license exemption has no relevance to mozilla.org since
it does not permit true export in the sense that would be required for
general distribution of cryptographic software outside the US.

<P>For more information see the US <A HREF="http://jya.com/eartoc.htm">Export
Administration Regulations</A>, particularly <A HREF="http://jya.com/740.htm#740.9">15
CFR Part 740.9, paragraph (a)(2)(i)</A> (license exemption for "tools of
trade"). <BR>

<A NAME="1-9"></A><B>What about people who send the "RSA in Perl" code
in their signature files or in other forms?  If they are able to do
this without US government interference, why can't mozilla.org export Mozilla
cryptographic source code without interference?</B></LI>

<BR>Many people in the US and elsewhere have taken to including in their
email signature files a short program in Perl implementing the RSA public
key algorithm.  The program is also available on T-shirts, and at
least one person has it as a tattoo.  Apparently none of these people
have encountered US government interference in their sending email messages
around the world with the RSA Perl code, traveling outside the US wearing
the T-shirts, and so on.

<P>However this has little direct relevance to the problem of mozilla.org
exporting cryptographic code as part of the general Mozilla distribution. 
RSA Perl code on T-shirts, tattoos, etc., is considered printed material
in the context of the export control regulations, and is therefore exempt
from those regulations.  RSA Perl code in an email signature file
is considered to be cryptographic software under the export regulations
(and in fact is in the same export control category as programs like Netscape
Communicator and PGP), but the situation of an individual sending a 3-line
cryptographic program as part of an email message is not comparable to
that of a company or organization distributing millions of lines of source
code for a mass market software product with extensive cryptographic capabilities.

<P>It is often the case that those enforcing government regulations could
potentially find many more violations of those regulations than could reasonably
be investigated in depth, let alone be referred for prosecution by law
enforcement agencies; government regulators would presumably be advised
therefore to devote relatively more attention to cases which have higher
visibility and a higher priority from the standpoint of preventing the
perceived potential problems that the regulations were written to address. 
In the case of export control regulations for cryptography, presumably
a major potential problem as perceived by US government regulators is the
possibility of widespread or even universal availability and use worldwide
of mass market desktop software implementing strong cryptography for common
operations such as electronic mail and web browsing.  It is therefore
reasonable to assume that a much higher priority would be placed on enforcing
export regulations in the case of such products than in the case of "RSA
in Perl" or similar programs, and that the chance of prosecution of an
organization distributing such mass market software contrary to US export
regulations would be significantly higher than the chance of prosecution
of individuals sending RSA Perl code in their signature files.  Whether
this is actually true or not, mozilla.org has chosen not to test the proposition.

<A NAME="1-10"></A><B>If I develop cryptographic code outside the US, will
mozilla.org accept it for inclusion in the standard Mozilla distribution?</B></LI>

<BR>mozilla.org is still considering this issue.  The potential problem
here is that even though individuals outside the US may be free to develop
cryptographic code (depending on the laws and regulations of the country
you're in), and that code may be legally imported into the US with no restrictions
whatsoever, reexport of that code from the US, even unmodified, requires
an export license exactly as if the code had been developed in the US originally. 
Thus if mozilla.org accepted contributions of cryptographic code from non-US
developers it would be unable to release that code for general distribution.

<P>It would be possible for mozilla.org to accept that code and to distribute
it (as a separate release) only to users based in the US and Canada. 
However this would require additional controls on downloading over and
above what mozilla.org is setting up for distribution of the general source
release.  There would also be the problem that US developers (including
developers at Netscape) who made modifications to the cryptographic code
would not be able to export those modifications back to the original developers
outside the US.  For these and related reasons mozilla.org has not
yet decided whether it will accept or distribute any cryptographic source
code at all, whether developed outside the US or not.

<P>For more information see the US <A HREF="http://jya.com/eartoc.htm">Export
Administration Regulations</A>, particularly <A HREF="http://jya.com/734.htm#734.4">15
CFR Part 734.4 paragraph (b)(2)</A>  (reexport of foreign-origin encryption
software) and <A HREF="http://jya.com/734.htm#734.2">734.2 paragraph (b)(9)</A>
(controls required for electronic distribution of cryptographic software). 
Incidentally, the phrase "there is no de minimis level for reexport..."
in 734.4 is a bit confusing.  The reference is to the succeeding paragraphs,
which exempt from the EAR reexport of  products that have less than
a certain percentage of US content, say 10% or 25%; this percentage is
the "de minimis level".  There is no such applicable percentage for
reexport of cryptographic software; even software with zero US content
may not be (re)exported from the US without an export license. <BR>
<BR>
<P><LI>
<A NAME="1-11"></A><B>Will mozilla.org release information on the format
of the Netscape Communicator key and certificate database, so that third-party
cryptographic code can reuse existing user keys and certificates?</B></LI>

<BR>mozilla.org is still considering this issue.  Note that US export
regulations require that US based individuals and organizations obtain
an export license in order to provide "technical assistance" to persons
outside the US, even in cases where no software is actually exported. 
The prohibition on such assistance is fairly broad, covering a range of
activities intended to "aid a foreign person in the development or manufacture
outside the United States of encryption commodities and software"; the
regulations explicitly exempt from this prohibition only "mere teaching
or discussion of information about cryptography" (presumably because prohibiting
these activities would likely be held unconstitutional on the basis of
the First Amendment to the US constitution).

<P>For more information see the US <A HREF="http://jya.com/eartoc.htm">Export
Administration Regulations</A>, particularly <A HREF="http://jya.com/734.htm#734.5">15

<A NAME="1-12"></A><B>Why is this even a problem for mozilla.org? 
Haven't US export controls on cryptographic software already been ruled
unconstitutional?<BR>
</B>For several years Professor Daniel Bernstein (of the University of
California at Berkeley) pursued a lawsuit against the US government essentially
claiming that US export control regulations on cryptographic software and
related conduct with regard to cryptography (e.g., "technical assistance"
as previously discussed) were unconstitutional.  (Bernstein's suit
was originally directed at the ITAR and related regulations, since at the
time the suit was filed the current Export Administration Regulations were
not yet in effect with respect to cryptographic software.)  On 25
August 1997 the US District Court for the Northern District of California
issued a final ruling (written by Judge Marilyn Hall Patel) that "the [US
government] encryption regulations are an unconstitutional prior restraint
in violation of the First Amendment."<BR>
<BR>
However this ruling does not settle the issue of the constitutionality
of US export control regulations, for two reasons.  First, the ruling
was effective only within the juridiction of the US District Court for
the Northern District of California.  Second, immediately after the
ruling the government requested and the District Court approved that the
ruling apply only to Professor Bernstein (and his original cryptographic
software, "Snuffle"), pending completion of the appeals process. 
The case is now being appealed by the US government to the 9th Circuit
Court of Appeals.  Until the appeals process is completed (with the
case perhaps going all the way to the US Supreme Court) the current US
export regulations continue to apply to all other individuals and organizations
in the US, including mozilla.org.<BR>
