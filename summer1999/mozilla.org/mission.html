<!-- created by jwz, 3-feb-98 -->


<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>our mission</H1>

<P> Netscape Communications made two important announcements on January 
23rd, 1998:

<UL>
<LI>
 <A HREF="http://www.netscape.com/newsref/pr/newsrelease560.html">First</A>,
 that the Netscape Communicator product would be available free of charge;
<LI>
 <A HREF="http://www.netscape.com/newsref/pr/newsrelease558.html">Second</A>,
 that the source code for Communicator would also be free.
</UL>

<P> On March 31st, the first developer release of the source code to
Communicator was made available.

<P> But what now?  For the product to grow and mature and continue to be
useful and innovative, the various changes made by disparate developers
across the web must be collated, organized, and brought together as a
cohesive whole.

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>mozilla.org</B><HR WIDTH="20%">

<P> A group exists within Netscape that is chartered to act as a 
clearing-house for the newly-available Netscape source.  That group is
<B>mozilla.org</B>.  We will provide a central point of contact
and community for those interested in using or improving the source 
code:

<UL>
<P><LI> We will collect changes, help authors synchronize their work, and
  periodically make new source releases which incorporate the best work of
  the net as a whole.

<P><LI> We will operate discussion forums (mailing lists, newsgroups, or
  whatever seems most appropriate.)

<P><LI> We will coordinate bug lists, keep track of and publicize works
  in progress, and generally attempt to provide ``roadmaps'' to the
  code, and to projects based on the code.

<P><LI> And we will, above all, be flexible and responsive.  We
  realize that if we are not perceived as providing a useful service,
  we will become irrelevant, and someone else will take our place.

<P><LI> We are <I><B>not</B></I> the primary coders.  Most of the code
  that goes into the distribution will be written elsewhere, both within
  the Netscape Client Engineering group, and, increasingly, <I>out there</I>
  on the net, at other companies and other development organizations.

  <P> We are code integrators.  And, through our forums, we will try to help
  people reach consensus, and thereby provide direction and coordination for
  future improvements.

</UL>

<P> It can be observed that all successful open-source software projects
follow this model of distributed development and centralized integration.
One of the fears that open-source software software neophytes often express
is that open availability of the source will lead to balkanization, that
there will eventually be thousands of different descendants of the original
software, and confusion and chaos will result.  But, in reality that doesn't
happen; organizations like <B>mozilla.org</B> tend to appear.  Eric Raymond
tries to explain why in his excellent paper,
<A HREF="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/">
The Cathedral and the Bazaar</A>.   We hope to operate in the ``Bazaar''
style, and be to the public Netscape source code as Linus Torvalds is 
to Linux.

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Mozilla</B><HR WIDTH="20%">

<P> ``Mozilla'' was the original code name for the product that came to be
known as Netscape Navigator, and later, Netscape Communicator.

<P> Later, it came to be the name of Netscape Communications Corporation's
dinosaur-like <A HREF="http://www.snafu.de/~tilman/mozilla/">mascot</A>.

<P> Now, we intend to use the name Mozilla as the generic term referring to
web browsers derived from the source code of Netscape Navigator.

<P> Netscape Communications Corporation holds trademarks on the names
Netscape, Navigator, and Communicator; it has not yet been decided what, if
any, restrictions Netscape will place on the use of those names.  However, a
generic term for browsers is still needed, and ``Mozilla'' is as good a name
as any.

<P> So, <B>Mozilla</B> is a family of web browsers, but not a specific
web browser (in biologic terms, Mozilla is a genus; Netscape Communicator 
is a species.)  And <B>mozilla.org</B> (pronounced ``Mozilla Dot Org'' or
``The Mozilla Organization'') is this group of people, the coordinators of 
the project.

<P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>how we operate</H1>
<P> As explained earlier, those of us here at
<B>mozilla.org</B> are not the primary coders of the Mozilla web browser.  We
function as a switchboard, facilitating the cooperation of the thousands of
participants out on the net.  And we assemble the fruit of that labor in one
place.


<P>
The real work gets done by people like you.

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Contributors</B><HR WIDTH="20%">

<P> How can you participate?  Simply by doing so!  We believe in ``deeds, not
words.''  We operate as a meritocracy, so the more good code you contribute,
the more you will be allowed to contribute: that is, the better a developer
you prove yourself to be through your actions, the more responsibility you
will be given.  This is not a ``Consortium.''  There is no such thing as
membership.  If you contribute code, then you're a member.  It's as simple as
that.

<P> Now, in our role as integrators of the work being done by the countless
others out on the net, we do have to have some rules.  If we just blindly
accept any patch thrown at us, pretty soon we'll have total chaos, and a
source tree that doesn't work, and that's no good for anybody.

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Module Owners</B><HR WIDTH="20%">

<P> The basic model we intend to operate under is that each major module will
have a designated owner.  That person will be the person who knows the code
best, and who feels that they are up to the task of being the arbiter of what
should go in to that module, and what shouldn't.  Chances are, this person
will also be the primary coder.  The module owner accepts improvements and
bug fixes from others on the net.

<P> One role of <B>mozilla.org</B> is to publicize the lists of module
owners, so that others who wish to coordinate with them can more easily do
so.  Another of <B>mozilla.org</B>'s functions is to direct incoming patches
or bug reports to the right module owner, in the case where the submitter of
the patch or report didn't know who the responsible party was.

<P> Changes to a module are made by that module's owner, and then sent to
<B>mozilla.org</B> for inclusion in our source distributions.  If the owner
of a module is new to the job, then we're probably going to work pretty
closely with them to make sure that we're actually helping each other out:
that they're giving us what we need to meet our desired level of quality, and
that we're giving them the information and assistance they need.  There are
no hard and fast rules here, but one thing that is definitely true is that
module owners will come to be judged, both by us and by the public, based on
what they've accomplished.

<P>The current list of module owners can be found
 <A HREF="owners.html">here</A>.

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Benevolent Dictator</B><HR WIDTH="20%">

<P> In this way, it's a self-regulating system: if a module owner is viewed
by the public as not doing a good job (perhaps their releases tend to be
buggy, or non-portable; or perhaps they aren't responsive to bug fixes or
suggestions) then what will happen is, someone out on the net will say to
themselves (and to us), ``<I>hey, I can do a better job than that.</I>''  
And we will say to them, ``<I>go right ahead.</I>''  

<P> If the usurper and the old module owner can't work out their differences,
then by default, the final decision becomes that of us here at
<B>mozilla.org</B>: we will be in a situation where there are two people
asking us to take their version of some particular module, and we're going to
pick the better one to include in our source releases.

<P> Now, hopefully it will almost never come to that.  In most cases, we
won't have to make those kinds of hard decisions, because people will tend to
work it out themselves, and cooperate, and accept help when it is offered.
There exists years of evidence in the open-source software community that 
such things tend to work themselves out without a big fuss.

<P> But, we here at <B>mozilla.org</B> decide what we put in the source
distributions that we make.  So that gives us final say on what goes
into <I>our</I> distributions.

<P> Of course, anyone anywhere in the world can make their own source
distributions: we aren't unique in that respect.  And that's another way
that the system is self-regulating: if the public believes that we are
making bad decisions about what to include and what not to include, about
whose work to use and whose not to, or anything of that nature, then the
public will vote with their collective feet: they will get their source
distributions from someone other than <B>mozilla.org</B>, and we will have
become irrelevant.

<P> This is the way nearly all successful open-source software projects work,
and that's why we're emulating it.  We call this the ``Benevolent Dictator'' 
model.  ``Dictator'' because there is one person (or organization) who
eventually gets final say in the case of disputes; and ``Benevolent'' 
because the dictator always tries to do the right thing.  Because if the
dictator stops doing the right thing, the dictator becomes ignored, and
ceases to be a dictator at all.

<P> For those more democratically-minded, another way of looking at it is
that the final arbiter really is something of an elected official: the voting
process consists of whether anyone listens to them.
