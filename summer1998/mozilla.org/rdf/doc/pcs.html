<h3>Persistent Client Store</h3>

The NavCenter related stores are all for the user
and are used to store personal information such
as bookmarks and history. A website cannot easily
gain access to these datastores (and most likely,
the user would not like the website to be able
to read his/her bookmarks etc.)

<P>

The technology can be repurposed to provide the
website a client side persistent store. The website
can read/write to this store using a javascript
reflection of the RDF APIs. 

<P>

The user sets size and longevity constraints on
these databases on a per domain basis. Each domain
can ask for its own database. A domain cannot read
the database of another domain. However, a domain
can explicitly give read/write permission (of its
PCS) to another domain. E.g., cnet.com might give
access to snap.com.

<P>
This feature can also be used to implement off-line
forms and other such applications. The database
is stored as an RDF file (one per domain). So, it
can easily be uploaded, etc. At this point, there
is no facility to store binary data into PCS, but
this can easily be added.
<P>
Most of the work to enable this feature has already
been done. The big remaining part is javascript reflection
of the RDF APIs.
