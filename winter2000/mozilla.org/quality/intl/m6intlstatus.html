<center><b><font size=+2>International M6 Status Page</font></b></center>

<p>by Katsuhiko Momoi
<br>Last Update: 5/27/99
<p>This page tracks the progress of M6 International features.&nbsp; By
the time M6 is completed, this page should have all the M6 features and
testing hints. If you are interested in what has been completed in the
prior Milestone. Visit the <a href="m5intlstatus.html">M5 international
status and testing hints</a> page. Much of this page also has been released
as M6 International Release information. But this page will be list further
update on the M6 information.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+1>M6 International features that
have been completed:</font></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>General:</font></b>
<ul>
<li>
If you have used an earlier version of Mozilla 5.0, we recommend that you
delete the file called <b>mozregistry.dat (Win) or registry (Unix/Mac)
</b>before
you run M6 apprunner. (Don't delete <b>Netscape Registry</b> file for Mac,
which is for Communicator 4.x.)&nbsp; This will avoid unnecessary problems/crashes
in some cases. Read the section in the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/seamonkey/release-notes/m6.html">M6
Release Notes</a> called
<b>Files Used or Created</b> to find out where
you can find these files.</li>

<li>
Also read the Installation instructions for your platform carefully in
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/seamonkey/release-notes/m6.html">M6
Release Notes</a>.</li>
</ul>
<b><font size=+1>Browser:</font></b>
<ul>
<li>
<b>HTML Meta Charset handling: </b>has been greatly improved! There is
no longer need to reload after a page has displayed. If a page has a correct
Meta Charset tag, it will be displayed correctly on the first load.</li>

<li>
<b>On Mac: </b>Multi-font rendering code has been re-written to improve
on display performance. We would like people to seriously look at web pages
with M6. We are very interested in performance/speed issues in loading
with M6. If there are performance issues, write to us.</li>

<li>
<b>View | Character Set menu:&nbsp;</b> You can switch to different encoding
when encountering a page which does not have a&nbsp; meta charset tag.
<font color="#FF0000">You will not see a checkmark next to the menu item
yet , however.</font></li>

<ul>
<li>
On Mac, some menu items were dimmed in M5 due to the limitation on the
number a Mac menu can carry. This problem was fixed in M6 and now all the
menu items are visible and enabled.</li>

<li>
The list is currently too long and unwieldy -- overall charset menu specs
are under consideration.</li>

<ul>
<li>
On Unix, there is no scrollable menu yet in GTK. Thus the Character set
menu items may not be all visible if your monitor screen size is 17 or
15 inches. For those people, we would like to offer temporary workaround
with reorganized menus.&nbsp; These modifications on <b>navigator.xul,mailshell.xul</b>,
and <b>msgcompose.xul</b> can be found <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/quality/intl/m6/unixchamenu">here</a>.&nbsp;
They have been tested to work on a 15-inch monitor screen. Please use the
".txt" files which contain just the International menu modifications for
each of the .xul files. The .xul files there were from the 5/21/99 Linux
build and posted simply as an example of how the whole thing looks. If
you would like to see what these modifications look like on the Browser
window, here is an <a href="ftp://momoi@kaze.mcom.com/u/momoi/mozilla-org/html/quality/intl/m6/unixchamenu/charmenusample.gif">GIF
image</a>. Note that the single menu has been split into 6 sub menus.</li>

<li>
Alternatively you can edit these files yourself to suit your needs using
what you find at the above site as an example. Look for a section which
begins: &lt;menu name="Default Character Set"> or&nbsp; &lt;menu name="Character
Set"> and place the Character set items you want to the top of the list.
You will find the 3 files to modify in the locations below:</li>

<ul>
<li>
Starting at where the apprunner binary is located: ../res/samples/navigator.xul</li>

<li>
Starting at where the apprunner binary is located: ../res/mailnews/messenger/mailshell.xul</li>

<li>
Starting at where the apprunner binary is located: ../res/mailnews/compose/msgcompose.xul</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<li>
On some NT4 machines, reloading may not work. This problem will be addressed
when the new NetLib code becomes available.&nbsp; As a workaround:</li>

<ul>
<li>
If you have one of these machines, switch the View | Character Set menu
before you go to the next site. Hopefully you know ahead of time what charset
the page is using.)&nbsp; If you experience the same problem of not being
able to reload, please let us know and provide info on whether or not your
problem is reproducible.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Improving muilti-font rendering on Win:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
Some bugs fixes were performed.</li>

<li>
No additional converters for M6:</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>On Linux</b> -- because we have not completed GFX Multi-font rendering
part yet, display works only for Latin1 and Japanese at the moment. Not
much change from M4 here.</li>
</ul>

<p><br><b><font size=+1>Editor:</font></b>
<ul>
<li>
Input method - on Windows, some improvements were made to make it easier
to use Japanese IME. More improvements are coming.</li>
</ul>

<p><br><b><font size=+1>Localizability:</font></b>
<ul>
<li>
Some do-it-yourself localization is now possible. Not much change in the
following items from M5.</li>

<ul>
<li>
XUL/XML/RDF files assume the default charset to be in UTF-8. If you change
UI strings to your favorite language, they should show OK as long as the
localized files use UTF-8 charset. (You can change menus to Japanese, for
example, in <b>res/samples/navigator.xul </b>file and then convert the
file to UTF-8 charset.) The menu items generally cannot be in languages
your system does not support, e.g.&nbsp; no Japanese menu for US Windows
is possible at the moment.</li>

<li>
<b>Limitation:</b> you cannot use charsets other than UTF-8 yet since XML
parser support of general entities in the external DTD files is yet to
be done. Although it is possible to have resource files for Mozilla to
be in charsets other than UTF-8, keep in mind that Mozilla will be standardizing
on UTF-8 for&nbsp; resource files.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<b><font size=+1>Mail/News (Windows only):</font></b>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Preferences file: prefs50.js</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
Mail (POP &amp; IMAP) and News viewing does not work unless you have a
correct <b>prefs50.js</b> file in the correct location for your platform.
Read <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/mailnews/prefs-info.html">this page
</a>and
set up the correct preferences before you do any mail testing. For the
location of the <b>prefs50.js</b> file, read the installation instructions
for your platform in <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/seamonkey/release-notes/m6.html">M6
Release Notes</a>.</li>

<li>
In addition to the general preferences items, international users should
also add the following 3 lines to the <b>prefs50.js</b>. The first controls
HTML/Plain Text mail option, the second and the third are musts for sending
out properly MIME-encoded mail body and headers, respectively. If you want
to send HTML mail, set the first option's value to "true". For M6, our
default is Plain Text since HTML mail has problems for some languages.
See below for more.</li>

<ul>
<li>
user_pref("mail.identity.id1.send_html", false);&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
// note that "id1" refers to the first account. If you have multiple accounts,
change "1" to appropriate numbers, e.g. "id2", etc.</li>

<li>
user_pref("mail.strictly_mime", true);</li>

<li>
user_pref("mail.strictly_mime_headers", true);</li>
</ul>

<li>
To get your POP mail working, it is best to have a small starter <b>Inbox</b>
file in the Mail directory you specified in <b>prefs50.js</b> file. We
have such a starter Inbox file for you <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/quality/intl/m6/">here</a>.
Get this file called <b>5.0firstinbox</b> and rename it to <b>Inbox</b>
and put it in your Mail directory.</li>

<li>
POP option is for leaving mail behind on the server after the messages
have been downloaded from the server. We recommend that you use a test
mail account for this purpose rather than using your regular mail account.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>International Sorting in Thread pane headers: </b>is now working. Sorting
is done according to the sort default for the language of your operating
system. Please test this for your language/OS and see if sorting is satisfactory.</li>

<li>
<b>International Date/Time format: </b>is now working. It uses the default
for your operating system's locale. The effect should be visible in the
thread pane date/time headers. Please check out this features for your
language/OS!</li>

<li>
<b>Multi-lingual mail viewing:&nbsp;</b> Not much change from M5.</li>

<ul>
<li>
If you have a multilingual font or several fonts which together cover the
Unicode ranges (e.g. Chinese, Japanese, Korean fonts + Pan-European fonts),
we use them in displaying mail messages and headers for all the languages
we support. We pay attention to the charset parameter in the Content-Type
header and switch to an appropriate font. The Encoding menu is not needed
to switch to different language views unless the message you're viewing
is incorrectly labeled. If you would like a basic mono-weight multi-lingual
font, you can get Bitstream Cyberbit font 2.0 <a href="ftp://ftp.netscape.com/pub/communicator/extras/fonts/windows/">here</a>.</li>

<li>
View | Character Set menu is currently not working to override wrong MIME
charset label.&nbsp; It can be used to view msgs which have no MIME charset
specified, however.</li>

<li>
On some <b>Windows</b> machines, for an unknown reason, Message Pane header
and body display may go wrong for non-ASCII messages containing 8-bit headers
and body. This problem is sporadic and on most machines we looked at, the
problem does not occur at all.&nbsp; If you encounter a reproducible set
of steps, please let us know.</li>

<li>
Attachments should be viewable if they are of the same charset as the main
body of the mail. Other charsets are not supported yet.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>View | Character Set menu for New Mail Compose window</b> is now working
for sending mail for many additional languages. Switch to the charset you
want to compose a message in and then compose the message.&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">You
will not see a checkmark next to the menu item yet , however. </font><font color="#000000">We
need a lot of people testing different charsets we put in for M6!</font></li>

<li>
<b>Sending Latin 1 mail: </b>Works in both HTML and Plain text.</li>

<ul>
<li>
Copy/paste accented characters into the headers and&nbsp; body works</li>

<li>
Keyboard input into headers (e.g. subject) also works for accented characters.
Using the English keyboard, ALTGr + 0+Number Keypad method works, e.g.
Right ALT key + 0232.</li>

<li>
Make sure to switch the <b>View | Character Set</b>&nbsp; to Latin 1 before
you send out a message.</li>

<li>
Basic MIME compliance is there: Header Q encoding, and Body QP encoding
for accented characters.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Sending Japanese mail: </b>works only in Plain text. HTML mail body
disappears upon "send".</li>

<ul>
<li>
Basic/primitive Japanese input now works. The mail composer body can retain
Japanese input.&nbsp; Japanese input/copying&nbsp; into Subject header
does not work yet, however. We are awaiting the arrival of new Ender/Editor
widgets for this feature.</li>

<li>
Mail goes out in ISO-2022-JP. (The Kanji-in escape sequence is that of
JISX0208-1976, however. )</li>

<li>
Make sure to switch the <b>View | Character Set&nbsp;</b> to Japanese (ISO-2022-JP)
before you send out a message.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Sending other charset mail</b> --<font color="#FF0000"> is now enabled.</font>
Please try out these new charsets! For example, <b>UTF-8 is working now.</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
Though the mail text body can sense what keyboard you have selected and
will switch font accordingly, there may be mapping bugs with some international
keyboards and so there is no guarantee that correct characters will be
input. Copy/paste may work better. Let us know what you find if you try
this.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Reply/Forward: </b>is basically working but there seem to be some display
bugs in the new mail composer. You may not always see the characters displayed
properly in&nbsp; your language though mail general arrives correctly.</li>

<li>
<b>IMAP Mail:</b> is working now, but not much international testing has
been done to determine how well. You can change the server type to "<b>imap</b>"
from "<b>POP3</b>" to indicate that the server in question is of IMAP type
in your prefs50.js file.</li>

<li>
<b>Viewing News: </b>is working. We have done some&nbsp; international
testing on this. In principle, multilingual news articles viewing should
work if they have correct MIME charsets indicated in the articles. Be warned,
however, that newsgroups postings are not always MIME-compliant and this
could defeat our charset honoring mechanism.</li>

<br>&nbsp;</ul>

<p><br><b><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+1>International features yet
to be completed:</font></font></b>
<blockquote>
<li>
No CJK IME support on Mac and Linux.</li>

<li>
Linux can only view Latin and Japanese.</li>

<li>
No Japanese Auto-Detect.</li>

<li>
No posting non-ASCII forms data.</li>

<li>
No CJK printing on Linux.</li>

<li>
HTTP charset won't be handled.</li>
