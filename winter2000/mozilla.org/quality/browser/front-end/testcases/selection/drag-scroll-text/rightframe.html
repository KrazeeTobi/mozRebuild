<P><B>How to Write a Useful Bug Report</B> <BR>
<BR>
Useful bug reports are ones that get bugs fixed. A useful bug report normally has
two qualities: <BR>
1.	<B>Reproducible.</B> If an engineer can't see it or conclusively prove that it
exists, the engineer will probably stamp it &quot;WORKSFORME&quot; or &quot;INVALID&quot;,
and move on to the next bug. Every detail you can provide helps. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
2.	<B>Specific.</B> The quicker the engineer can trace down the issue to a specific
problem, the more likely it'll be fixed expediently. If you're crashing on a site,
please take the time to isolate what on the page is triggering the crash, and include
it as an HTML snippet in the bug report if possible. <BR>
<BR>
(Specific bugs have the added bonus of remaining relevant when an engineer actually
gets to them; in a rapidly changing web, a bug report of &quot;foo.com crashes my
browser&quot; becomes meaningless after the site experiences a half-dozen redesigns
and hundreds of content changes.)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Let's say you crash at foo.com, and want to write up a bug report: <BR>
<B>BAD:</B> &quot;Mozilla crashed. I think I was on foo.com. My computer uses Windows.
I think that this is a really bad problem and you should fix it now.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<B>GOOD: </B>&quot;I crashed each time when I went to foo.com, using the 2.28.99
build of Seamonkey on a Win NT 4.0 (Service Pack 3) system. I also rebooted into
Linux, and reproduced this problem using the 2.28.99 Linux build.<BR>
<BR>
Apprunner crashed each time upon drawing the Foo banner at the top of the page. I
broke apart the page, and discovered that the following image link will crash Apprunner
reproducibly, unless you remove the &quot;border=0&quot; attribute:<BR>
<BR>
&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;http://foo.com/images/topics/topicfoos.gif&quot; width=34 height=44
border=0 alt=&quot;News&quot;&gt;&quot; <BR>
We'd also recommend reviewing a few of the better bug reports, such as <FONT COLOR="#0000EE">2683</FONT>,
<FONT COLOR="#0000EE">3092</FONT> or <FONT COLOR="#0000EE">4044</FONT>. Bug submissions
that do not meet these &quot;Useful Bug Report&quot; criteria tend to be investigated
on a time-available basis.
