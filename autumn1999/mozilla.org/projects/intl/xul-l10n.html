<h2>
Localizability issues</h2>

Historically, we encountered some difficulties in
localizing Web-based documents: 

<ul> 
<li>Locale sensitive data is hard to separate from the rest of the document. 
  Localizable resources reside in the same file with language and culture 
  neutral data. Localizing Web-based documents often means going through the
  whole set of document to identify and translate localizable resources.</li>

<li>Markup tags are often translated or damaged in the process of localization.
  Validating the localization results is difficult, if not impossible.</li> 
</ul>
 
It is the desire of the Mozilla Internationalization group to address these issues in the XUL world.
 
<h2>
Criteria of the solution</h2>

Before embarking on the solution-seeking journey, let?s layout a set of 
criteria we intend to meet:

<ul>
<p><li><b>Standard Compliant</b>. We shall avoid re-inventing the wheel. Both 
  existing internationalization solutions and new proposals shall be taken 
  into consideration. We will weight in standard compliance in the decision 
  making process against proprietary approaches.</li></b>

<p><li><b>Simple</b>. The localizability solution shall be easy to implement, 
  and will integrate seamlessly with core development. A localizability 
  solution often needs the support from peer development groups. Should 
  localization enabling become a burden or even hinder the development process,
  the proposed solution would less likely be accepted by supporting module 
  owners.</li></b>

<p><li><b>Leveragible</b>. Leveraging can be defined as taking the localization 
  results of previous releases for the use of the current release. A 
  full-scale localization of a huge software product is not only 
  time-consuming but also costly. It requires collaborative effort from 
  localization engineers, translation vendors, and internationalization QA 
  throughout the whole 
  process. It is neither economic nor efficient to repeat the whole process 
  from scratch for each release. Leveraging also helps improve the consistency
  of translation between releases.</li></b>

<p><li><b>Portable</b>. The final solution will be achievable on all platforms 
  including
  Unix, Windows, Mac, and others. We do not want a solution for one platform 
  and another solution for the other platform. The majority of Mozilla modules
  are platform-independent, so will be the localizability solution.</li></b>

<p><li><b>Extensible</b>. Technology evolves. A solution adopted now might not be
  valid 
  in the future, however, we want it to be flexible enough for future 
  extension.</li></b>

<p><li><b>Separable</b>. To simplify the localization task, localizable resources
  shall
  be placed into external files so that the translators can concentrate
  on localization instead of language or culture neutral resources.</li></b>

<p><li><b>Consistent</b>. If possible, we shall seek a scheme that will work 
  across 
  modules instead of within the XUL component only. We don't want to have 
  distinguished solutions for different modules.</li></b>

<p><li><b>Dynamic binding</b>. Some of the resources requiring translation may be 
  dynamic, usually because they require string composition, e.g., "Installing
  item 5 of 10".</li></b> 

<p><li><b>Validatable</b>. The result of localization shall be easily validated. 
  Translators need to be able to verify the result as they progress.</li></b> 

<p><li><b>Parseable</b>. It should be possible to unambiguously and automatically 
  determine which embedded items contain localizable text, and which items 
  need not be localized.</li></b> 

<p><li><b>Invisible (Internationalization)</b>. As much as possible, the standard tools 
  that create English UI should emit files that are ready to be localized, 
  without requiring additional processing. We want to make the localizability 
  solution a part of the standard XUL authoring process instead of 
  internationalization specific action. Localizability shall not be the only 
  reason we adopt the solution.</li></b> 

<p><li><b>Efficient.</b> The implementation of the solution shall not cause 
  any noticeable performance degradation or memory bloat.</li></b> 

</ul>

While it might not be feasible to find a solution that satisfies all the criteria, they shall be used as the factors in decision making.

<h2>
<a NAME="l12ydendency"></a>XUL Localizability dependency</h2>

The XUL localizability has dependency on the following items.

<ul>
<p><li><a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/intl/xul-styleguide.html">XUL Coding Style Guidelines</a>: posted to newsgroup.</li></p>

<p><li>
XUL/XML parser dependency</li>

<br><br>The proposed XUL Localizability solution 
  (see http://www.mozilla.org/projects/intl/xul-l10n.html for more 
   information.) requires two features from XML parser:

<ul>
<p><li>
  General entities substitution. The proposal requires all localizable 
  resources to be declared as general entities in a language-specific 
  external DTD.</li></p>

<p><li><a NAME="chromesystemid"></a>
  Location of this DTD will be determined by the combination of system 
  (or application) locale and the URI referenced by the SYSTEM identifier 
  in the doctype declaration. The current solution is to take the advantage 
  of the
  chrome type URLs as described in 
  <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/xpfe/ConfigChromeSpec.html">Configurable
  Chrome</a>.</li></p> 

  In XUL, the system ID is written as

  <ul>
	<br>&lt;!DOCTYPE xui SYSTEM "chrome://navigator/locale/toolbar.dtd">
  </ul>

  <p>Assume the base part of chrome URL is being converted into 
     "resource:/navigator" and the current system locale is "fr", then the 
     parser will fetch

 <ul>
	<br>"resource:/navigator/locale/fr/toolbar.dtd"
 </ul>

<p>for entity declarations.
</ul>

<p>To sum up, the XUL localizability dependency on XML parser is
<ul>
<br><li>
Internal and external general entity support.</li>

<li>
External DTD support.</li>


</ul>
</p>
</ul>

<h2>
Candidates of the final solution</h2>

<ol>
<p><b><li><a NAME="pro1">XUL + language-specific DTD. (adopted)</a></b>

  <p><i><b>Description:</b></i> 

      <p>In this approach, we declare general (text) 
      entities for all locale sensitive resources in an external DTD 
      (Document Type Definition) subset and use XML entity reference, 
      "&entity;", to reference them:</p>

  <ul>
     <li>Put all localizable resources in a language DTD file. Example of such
         resources are text strings, customizable icons, and URLs. Most of
         them can be described by <b>text/parsed entities</b>.</li>
     <li>Non locale sensitive resources shall not be in this DTD file.</li>
     <li>Use <b>SYSTEM</b> identifier to reference this DTD file.</li>
     <li>Use chrome type URLs to <a href="#chromesystemid">locate</a>
         the external DTD subset.</li>
     <li>Put format strings, such as "Item %d of %d", in text entities and
         compute the value in the application code such as MailCore or 
         BrowserCore.</li>
     <li>To dynamically switch languages, we need to reload the XUL and its 
         DTD (probably from a remote host). This is because once the DOM tree
         is created, the entities and DTDs have already been processed. 
   </ul>

  <p><i><b>Sample XUL: toolbar.xul</b></i> 
  <ol>
    <br>&lt;!DOCTYPE xui SYSTEM "chrome://navigator/locale/toolbar.dtd">
	<br>
    <br>&lt;xul:toolbar>
    <ol>
         <br><b>&txtContentData;</b>
         <br>&lt;button cmd="nsCmd:BrowserBack"
                          style="background-color:rgb(192,192,192);">
         <ol>
             &lt;img src="chrome://navigator/locale/TB_Back.gif"/>
             <br><b>&txtBack;</b>
          </ol>
          &lt;/button>

          <br><br>&lt;button 
             cmd="nsCmd:BrowserForward" 
             style="background-color:rgb(192,192,192);">
         <ol>
              &lt;img src="chrome://navigator/locale/TB_Forward.gif"/>
             <br><b>&txtForward;</b>
          </ol>
          &lt;/button>

          <br><br>&lt;button
             cmd="nsCmd:BrowserWizard" 
             style="background-color:rgb(192,192,192);">
         <ol>
              &lt;img src="<b>&iconWizard;</b>"/>
             <br><b>&txtWizard;</b>
          </ol>
          &lt;/button>
    </ol>
    <br>&lt;/xul:toolbar>

  </ol>

  <p><i><b>Sample DTD: toolbar.dtd</b></i> 
  <ol>
    <br>&lt;!ENTITY <b>txtContentData</b>    "Random content data">
    <br>&lt;!ENTITY <b>txtBack</b>    "Back to &#38;#37;s">
    <br>&lt;!ENTITY <b>txtForward</b> "Forward">
    <br>&lt;!ENTITY <b>iconWizard</b> "chrome://navigator/locale/TB_Wizard.gif">
    <br>&lt;!ENTITY <b>txtWizard</b>  "Wizard">
  </ol>

   <p><i><b>Pros:</b></i>
   <ul>
     <li>Already standard compliant; no new syntax names or tags need to be
         introduced.</li>
     <li>Text replacement can be in either content or attribute values
         (but not in the attribute names).</li>     
   </ul>
   
   <p><i><b>Cons:</b></i>
   <ul>
     <li>The language-specific DTD file is not flat file. Need a DTD parser
         to extract localizable resources into a flat file for localizers.</li>
     <li>Two file formats to deal with: the property file and the DTD
         file.</li>
     <li>Hard to group text entities by UI components. Note that 
         <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/intl/xul-styleguide.html#howwdgt">
         XUL Coding Style Guidelines</a> recommends XUL writers to name 
         entities after the target widgets.</li>
     <li>We lose the information of text entities after parsing.</li>
     <li>In switching languages, we need to reload the XUL and its 
         DTD (probably from a remote host) and reconstruct the DOM tree. 
         <p>In the example of a dialog UI, if we used entities and DTDs, we
         would have to tear down the whole DOM tree and the dialog that sits
         on top of that, and then rebuild a new DOM tree and dialog. This
         would be wasteful, since our layout manager is able to resize
         elements dynamically, so we can "edit" the DOM tree and have the
         dialogs redraw themselves automatically.

         <p>However, we can live with this performance drag since the users
           might not switch language in runtime that often.
      </li>
      <li>Need to escape "%" used in formatting string,
         such as "%d out of %d" for dynamic strings binding. For example,
         use a numeric character reference (NCR), '&#38;#37;' to escape
         '%'.</li>

   </ul>
</li>

<b><p><li><a NAME="pro2">Resource ID + String Resource Manager. 
         (ruled out due to technical difficulty)</a></b>

<p><i><b>Descriptions:</b></i>
  <ul>
  <li>In XUL file, assign a widget ID, e.g. widgetID, to each UI element and a
      resource tag, e.g. resTag, to each localizable attribute of the
      widget. Then, during widget initialization, call a C function, said 
      gettext(widgetID, resTag, default_string), to retrieve the resource from a
      Java-like property file. For example, a label widget can be described as 
      <label widgetID="345" text="label string"/> in a XUL file. Then,
      the function call to retrieve localized text will be 
      gettext(345, RES_TEXT, "label string").</il>

  <li>The English version of property file will be automatically generated 
      during XUL to DOM conversion. The front-end developers can easily
      update a UI element's attribute/resource without leaving the XUL file.</il>

  <li>All localizable resources are uniquely identified by the combination of 
      widget ID and resource tag. </il>

  <li>In function "gettext()", if the property file does not exist or the 
      combination of widget ID and resource tag does not resolve to a resource
      string, the "default_string" will be returned instead. </il>
  </ul>

    <p>gettext(8001, RES_TEXT, "Back to &#38;#37;s")
  </ol>

<p><i><b>Pros</b></i>
<ul>
<li>All localizable resources are uniquely identified by the combination of 
    widgetID and the resource tags. The application/front end developers
    can easily update a UI element's attribute/resource.</li>
<li>Core development work will not be block by gettext() implementation. 
    However, we shall request the UI developers to put English string,
    localization notes, and comments in the property file.</li>
<li>The fallback mechanism allows the developers to work without the 
    presence of property files.</li>
<li>The English version of property file can be automatically generated 
    during XUL to DOM conversion.</li>
<li>Provide fallback mechanism to default strings.</li>
<li>The property file is flat and in clear text; easy to localize and 
    leverage.</li> 
<li>The implementation of nsStringBoundle interface is about to finish. The
    basic facilities of parsing the property file and retrieving text are
    ready to check in.</li>
<li>Consistent with the scheme in "String Resources"; only one file format
    to deal with.</li>
<li>Resources are grouped by widgets. This also makes the property file more
    readable.</li>
<li>Easy to leverage the property file. All resources are IDed and ready for
    comparision.</li>
</ul>

<p><i><b>Cons</b></i>
<ul>
<li>Need to treat content data as the text resource of a label widget. (So
    it can be identified and edited by application code.)
    </li>
<li>Need to implement a mechanism to automatically bind localizable resources
    to widgets. However, the amount of work can be reduced by performing
    the localized resources binding in widget initialization time since
    we need to bind the UI attributes in the DOM to the underlying widgets
    anyway.</li>
<li>Need to ensure the uniqueness of the widgetID. However, the appCore 
    developers need to have a way to uniquely identify a widget anyway.</li>
<li>Localizable resources strings are duplicated twice: one in XUL and the 
    other in property file.</li>
<li>Need to extend the Java-like property file to support structured 
    resources.</li>
<li><i><b>Technical difficulty:</b></i>once XUL has been converted to 
        DOM tree, the content can't be changed anymore.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p><b><li><a NAME="pro4">"@.*;" + property file</a></b>

  <p><i><b>Description:</b></i>
  Assuming the "timely access" problem can be overcome, we could get around the
  "syntax constraint" problem by using an entity-like syntax of our own. That 
  is, we invent something, say we use the "@" symbol like entities use the "&"
  symbol. Then these things are used throughout the content just like entities 
  would have been used to do localization. This still assumes we have some way 
  to get at the language-specific-substitution text after parsing (so it can't 
  be a parser directive; it may have to be some sort of special element that
  XUL will recognize and not display). If all this worked, we'd be free to add 
  localizable text anywhere without constraining the element and attribute 
  structure. 

  <p>For example 

	  <ul>
		  <br>&lt;element l10nID="100" text="english version"/> 
	  </ul>

  <p>becomes 

	  <ul>
		  <br>&lt;element text="@100;"/> ( or &lt;element>@100;&lt;/element>, 
		  if that's more appropriate for the widget). 
	  </ul>

  <p>There just needs to be a central single routine that knows where to find 
     the table of localized text strings. It finds "@.*;" sequences and
     substitutes them. We have to walk the content model after parsing and hand
     every string to this routine, and widgets have to pass all their
     text strings through it before they do anything with them.
 
 <p><i><b>Cons:</b></i>
  <ul>
  <li><b><i>The entity solution is more XML compliant and less work to implement.</i></b>
  </li>
  </ul>

</li>

<p><b><li><a NAME="pro5">Using XLinks and XPointers for XUL Localisation 
   (by Daniel McGowan) (ruled out due to technical difficulty)</a></b>

<p><b><u>Abstract:</u></b>
<br>Use XLink &amp; Xpointer to specifically reference a text in a file that is 
  separate from the base XUL file so that this text can be easily
  localized and displayed to the end user in a manner consistent with XPFE 
  (Cross Platform Front End) requirements.

       
<p><b><u>Pros:</u></b>
<br>
  Since it is all written in vanilla XML there is no need to create custom file 
  types. Thus this system can accept anything the parser can handle. It
  maintains the name value paring essential for localization. It allows us to 
  add localization and developer notes to the object (e.g. button) and the 
  localized text separately, but maintain a direct link between the two. The 
  text is pulled into the UI elements when the XUL file is parsed. This also 
  addresses the goal of separating markup, style and content. 

<br><b><u>Cons:</u></b>
<br>This does not leave us with a flat file solution. However the file
containing the text to be localised is of such a simple format that writing
a tool to parse it is a trivial exercise. We are going need some form of
tool to convert native encoding to unicode character references.
<br>There are 4 files to track! Actually the language specific DTD is complete
and valid as is so it could easily be declared inline in the language specific
XML file. The link-attributes has been entitised and could conceivably
be inherited from a higher level DTD.

(which is #REQUIRED) is automatically (actuate = 'auto') embedded (show
= 'embed') with the text from the &lt;text> child element of the element
with id = 1234 in the file at URI location which is the value of &amp;locale(some
more globally set value)/UILANG.XML.

<td>Criteria to examine</td>

<td>XUL +&nbsp;Language-specific DTD</td>

<td>XUL + Language-specific property file</td>

<td>Description</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Simple</td>

<td>*****</td>

<td>**** Need to define resources tags in widget code and widgetID in XUL 
    file.</td>

<td>Both core development and localization work shall be made  easy and 
    less error prone.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Leveragible</td>

<td>*** Need a parser to list, identify, and compare resources.</td>

<td>***** All resources are in property files which are flat and easier for
    leveraging.</td>

<td>Localization results shall be leveragible from release to release.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Consistent</td>

<td>*** Two file formats, DTD and property file, to deal with.</td>

<td>***** Only one file format, property file.</td>

<td>This scheme that will work across modules instead of within the XUL
component only.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Standard compliant</td>

<td>*****</td>

<td>**** (We can extend property file format to have similar syntax to
          X/MOTIF's application default file.)</td>

<td>Achievable on all platforms including Unix, Windows, Mac, and others.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Portable</td>

<td>*****</td>

<td>*****</td>

<td>Achievable on all platforms including Unix, Windows, Mac, and others.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Extensible</td>

<td>***** In the same direction as XML.</td>

<td>****  Need to treat content data as the text resource of a label widget.</td>

<td>The adopted solution will be flexible for customization and future
extension.&nbsp;</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Dynamic binding</td>

<td>*** Resources binding mostly appens in XML parser.</td>

<td>***** Resources binding occurs at the last minute.</td>

<td>Some of the items requiring translation may be dynamic, usually because
they require string composition ("Installing item 5 of 10").</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Validatible</td>

<td>*** (need a DTD parser)</td>

<td>***** (right on the scene)</td>

<td>Localizers/translators will be able to validate the localization
results.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Parsable</td>

<td>*** (DTD file contains XML tags, keywords, and others)</td>

<td>***** (localizable resources are easily identified)</td>

<td>It should be possible to unambiguously and automatically determine
    which embedded items contain localizable text, and what items need to be
    locked.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Invisible (Internationalization)</td>

<td>*** (entity defined in external DTD)</td>

<td>**** (developers need to assign an id to each resource; but the generation
          of the US/EN property file could be done by the XUL parser.)</td>

<td>As much as possible, the standard tools that create US UI should emit
    files that already localizable, without requiring additional 
    processing.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Identifiable</td>
<td>**** (entity names are unique; but we lose them after parsing.)</td>
<td>**** (all resources are identified by the combination of widgetID and
          resTag; but we must treat content data as the text resource of a
          label widget) </td>
<td>All resources shall be uniquely identifiable</td>

<tr>
<td>Dynamic Language Switching</td>
<td>*** Need to reload the XUL</td>
<td>**** We can design it to modify localizable attributes only.</td>
<td>Dynamically switch to different language and reflect it to UI. 
    (this does not happen quite often.)</td>
</tr>

Document History (old)</h2>

<ul>
<li>03/25/99: Add <a href="#l12ydendency">XUL Localizability dependency</a>.
<li>02/26/99: Correct entity reference syntax.</li>
<li>02/19/99: Insert two XUL L12y solutions <a href="#pro4">""@.*;" + 
    property file"</a>, proposed by Daniel Matejka, and <a href="#pro5">
   "Using XLinks and XPointers for XUL Localisation"</a> by Daniel McGowan.
   </li>
<li>02/17/99: At last, a consensus of the solution for XUL localizability has been reached. The <a href="#pro1">"XUL + language-specific DTD"</a> is adopted.  </li>
<li>02/10/99: In solution #2, relax the rule that the content data must
    be a text attribute value; instead, treat content data as the element
    content. See the samples in solution #2.</li>
<li>02/09/99: Add explanation of the "default string" to solution #2.</li>
<li>02/08/99: Add "How to locate the language-specific file" section.</li>
<li>02/08/99: Take out all out-dated sections.</li>
<li>02/08/99: Re-evaluate solution #1 and #2 in the comparison table.</li>
<li>02/08/99: Revised solution #2 to reduce the number of IDs needed for
    resources identification. In the revised version, resources are uniquely 
    identified by the combination of widget ID and resource tag. 
    Java-property file format is also extended to support structuralized
    resources.</li>
<li>02/05/99: Revamp the "Candidates of the final solution" section and
    add a table of comparison.</li>
<li>02/05/99: Compile for final review; record more discussion.</li>
<li>01/29/99: Record more discussion.</li>

<li>01/28/99: Added two sections: "Ideas" and "Candidates of the final 
 solution".</li>

<li>01/28/99: Compiled feedback from Daniel Matejka.</li>

01/25/99: Post this document to newsgroup, 
news://news.mozilla.org/netscape.public.mozilla.xpfe,
for broader audience and discussion.</li>

<li>
01/25/99: Per Scott Collins, http://www.meer.net/ScottCollins/, not all
UI widgets can be described in XUL file. Q: does this mean we need another
mechanism to solve the non-XUL UI components?</li>

<li>
01/20/99: Add a new section, "How does the XUL concept work?"</li>

<li>
01/20/99: In the "XUL Localizability issues" held today, it's proposed
that</li>

<ul>
<p><li>
Get more up-to-date documents on XUL spec architecture so
that we can come up with a solution.</li>
<li>
Need get a workable sample XUL application so that we can identify the
problem better.</li>

<li>
Choose from option #1 and #2 to embed localization
information in XUL. Then combine the strength of option #3, String Resources,
option #4, gettext() as the underlying mechanism to retrieve text strings.
We may load the string resources from a locale suffixed property file and 
fall back to the default strings, as described in gettext(), when needed.</li>

<font color="#FF0000"><i>
<p>1 and 2 are mostly headaches for localization and build people, 
and I can't really speak for them.  But both numbers 3 and 4 demand extra 
implementation work.</i>

</ul>

<p><li>
01/20/99: Incorporate Rob Thorne's comments and suggestions (in <font color="#3333FF">blue</font><font color="#000000">).</font></li>

<li>
01/19/99: Add reference to Erik's
 <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/intl/string-resources.html">String
Resources</a> . We might be able to consolidate the idea presented there
with the gettext() scheme.</li>
