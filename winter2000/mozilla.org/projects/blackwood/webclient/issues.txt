This file is a simple solution to the problem of tracking webclient
implementation issues.  It may not be the final solution to this
problem.

edburns  Come up with list of things that need to be implemented

?        Prioritize this list and parcel out implementation tasks

?        What to do when the custom app calls a part of the spec that isn't 
         implemented: a) fail silently, b) throw a NotImplemented
         exception, c) have a programmatic way of determining what is
         implemented and then throw a NotImplemented exception if
         necessary.

?        Do we fit the bill for fetch and context progress callbacks as
         defined in the vertigo spec: 

> > Fetch progress callbacks
> >
> > A fetch progress callback gives information on the status of a single
> > fetch. The kind of information provided in a fetch progress callback is:
> > "How many bytes have been downloaded so far?", "How many bytes remain to
> > be downloaded?", "has the fetch stalled?", etc.
> >
> > Context progress callbacks
> >
> > A context progress callback gives information on the status of a group
> > of fetches. The kind of information provided in a context progress
> > callback is: "how many items in this context have been fetched or remain
> > to be fetched?", etc.
> >
> > Information common to both kinds of callbacks includes: "What's the %
> > complete of this fetch?", "what is the network status of this fetch
> > (connecting, downloading, etc)?".
