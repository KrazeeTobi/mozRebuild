<P>Editor: This is where we'll add guidelines about what C++ features to avoid 
  so as to promote portability, how to add documentation, etc. For now, it just 
  contains some notes about white-space conventions.
<p>Many of the files in ElectricalFire were created before the conventions below 
  were adopted. Hence, not all EF code is conformant, but we will gradually make 
  it so.</p>
<H4>Tab characters</H4>


<OL>
<LI>
The use of tab characters is discouraged since there is no cross-platform
convention for uniformly displaying files which contain tabs.&nbsp; However,
since some toy editors make it difficult to abstain from using them, tab
characters are not actually forbidden.

<LI>
Tab stops are four character positions apart, i.e. tab stop positions are
0, 4, 8, 12, etc.

<BR>Note: this is not the same as saying that tab characters expand to
four spaces.</OL>

<H4>Indentation</H4>


<OL>
<LI>
When indenting is applicable, code shall be indented four character positions.
This rule applies to the creation of new blocks and to the interior of
switch statements.&nbsp; It doesn't govern the formatting of case labels.
</OL>

<TD>It is suggested that the following comment be placed as the first line
of all C++ and header files to make it easier for emacs users to follow
the guidelines concerning tabs and indenting:

<P><TT>// -*- mode:C++; tab-width:4; c-basic-offset:4; indent-tabs-mode:nil
-*-</TT>

Don't insert tab characters.&nbsp; Instead, insert the appropriate
number of spaces when the tab key is pressed.
